== Introduction

____
Every day, business is done while neglecting some of our most important
partners: Farmers and the Earth. The result are destructive global
consequences like climate change, desertification, and resource
depletion that affect nearly every aspect of human life. The United
Nations FAO estimates [.mark]#33% of the Earth's soils are already
degraded and over 90% could become degraded by
2050#footnote:[[.mark]#FAO and ITPS, 2015; IPBES, 2018#][.mark]#.#

The price tag to ‘fix’ these problems is estimated to be in the
trillions, paralyzing global efforts to quickly address climate change.
There may be nothing of more critical importance today than the
regeneration of the world’s ecosystems.

Farmers, the stewards of our global landscapes, offer one of the most
powerful pathways for reversing climate change and unlocking a massive
untapped market in the world: the services and products generated by
Earth’s ecosystems. Regen Registry coupled with Regen Ledger, an
ecological blockchain-based ledger, create a new platform for farmers to
monetize their ecological data while receiving rewards for sustainable
practices. By improving the understanding of the state of our land,
oceans, and watersheds and enabling rewards for verified positive
changes, Regen Network catalyzes the regeneration of our ecosystems.

Regen Network was launched in Q2, 2018 and is headquartered in Great
Barrington, Massachusetts.
____

== Overview

____
The Program Guide details the general requirements and specifications
for the quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV),
project registration, and issuance of credits on Regen Registry. The
common characteristic of all Regen Registry credits is that they are all
nature-based solutions, and each can provide one or more ecosystem
services, including GHG emissions reductions and removals,
biodiversity/habitat protection, improvement in water quality, and
morefootnote:[Note, the taxonomy of carbon markets and climate
mitigation varies from ecosystem services].

The Program Guide establishes the programmatic structure of Regen
Registry, including credit classes and methodologies, the project
registration process, project eligibility, and the issuance of tradable
environmental assets to projects. This guide is intended to be used by
Project Proponents, buyers, Monitors, Verifiers, and all other
stakeholders.

Regen Registry aims to maximize flexibility and usability for Project
Proponents while maintaining the environmental integrity and scientific
rigor necessary to ensure that projects developed against its credit
classes and methodologies are of the highest quality.

Project Proponents developing a project for registration on Regen
Registry shall follow this Program Guide and must apply a Regen Registry
approved credit class and methodology.

Project Proponents and other interested stakeholders should refer to the
Regen Registry website for the latest version of the Program Guide,
methodologies, document templates, and other guidance. Regen Registry
will inform Project Proponents with active projects directly to avoid
any potential disruptions.

Description
____

____
Regen Registry is an open source ecosystem services registry in which
Project Proponents can register projects, apply for credits, and
transfer and sell credits to buyers. Buyers can resell or retire credits
(in the case of carbon credits). Each credit vintage issued has a unique
ID, is project-based, is geospatially tagged and independently
verifiedfootnote:[If an independent verification is required by the
respective Credit Class].

Regen Registry aims to provide an open source, vertically integrated
solution that provides:

{empty}a) Digital MRV - software infrastructure that provides monitoring
tools - through in-house remote sensing and interoperability with 3rd
party tools - that streamline the cost and issuance of credits.

{empty}b) Marketing platform - showcases the unique story of each
project, highlighting the land stewards, the impact on the land and
environment; provides buyers and policy makers with impact analytics on
a portfolio (regional, national, and global) of key ecological
indicators.

{empty}c) Marketplace and exchange (trading platform) - sellers offer
their credits for sale; buyers purchase from one or multiple projects
and build a portfolio; the system provides a clearing [.mark]#and
settlement infrastructure including# payments and billing.

{empty}d) Regen Ledger - a custom-built ecological ledger using
blockchain technology where credits are issued and transferred, and
monitoring and verification claims are recorded as immutable records.

Each layer offered within the Regen Registry is standalone and Project
Proponents can choose which ones to use. For example, a Project
Proponent can choose to perform the monitoring in-house, based on the
methodology guidelines, rather than use a Monitor that leverages our
software stack. That said, integrated use of all layers will enable
significant advantages in ease-of-use, effectiveness, and cost
efficiency.

== Guiding Principles

[arabic, start=4]
. {blank}
+
____
Accuracy
____

____
The Project Proponent shall reduce, as far as is practical,
uncertainties related to the quantification of GHG removals and/or any
other applicable ecological indicator, such as species habitat, tree
coverage, etc.

Methodologies submitted for Regen Registry approval shall include
methods for estimating the uncertainty for each indicator. [.mark]#If
the width of the 90% confidence interval exceeds 20%, an appropriate
confidence deduction shall be applied.#

The use of models, such as biogeochemical models, must include an
estimate of structural uncertainty related to the inadequacy of the
model, model bias, and model discrepancy. Monitors shall quantify these
using the best available science, Monte Carlo analyses, uncertainty
estimates from peer reviewed literature, and/or consulting model experts
who have either developed or worked directly with the model in an
academic setting.
____

[arabic, start=5]
. {blank}
+
____
Comparability
____

____
Methodologies approved on Regen Registry shall rely on comparable
peer-reviewed studies as best as possible.

Further, Regen Registry is building infrastructure for automated
monitoring processes that will enable, once monitoring has been
performed for a given project, to have an independent party run that
same monitoring process again, at will, in order to compare the results.
We believe this will provide a new level of transparency and assurance
to monitoring processes.

____
User-Centric Design
____

____
Relative to their potential, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU) carbon credits have seen limited adoption in regulatory and
voluntary markets. Historically, the supply of these credits has been
limited because credit design has not incorporated enough feedback from
land stewards, resulting in credit requirements that were complicated,
expensive and/or time consuming. Regen Registry follows a user centric
design of credit classes and methodologies with input not only from
buyers but also land stewards and project developers.
____

== Governance 

____
Regen Registry is built on the principles of openness, collaboration,
accountability, user centric design, transparency, responsiveness, and
participation. This is applied to Credit Class and Methodology design,
provision of monitoring and verification services, integration with
other registries, and with 3rd-party service providers.

Regen Registry relies on a software implementation that includes two
layers: a) Regen Registry platform - a centralized software layer that
provides user accounts, project pages, administrative functions and b)
Regen Ledgerfootnote:[Integration of Regen Registry and Regen Ledger is
targeted for Q2 2021] - a decentralized software layer that is used to
issue, transfer, and retire credits and tracks all pertinent monitoring,
reporting and verification (MRV) information as immutable records.

Regen Registry is operated by Regen Network Development, Inc (RND), a
private for-profit company. Regen Ledger is a public decentralized
ledger that is not owned by a single entity (including RND) and is a
Digital
Commonsfootnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)[[.underline]#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)#]]
that is operated by a network of independent stakeholders called
Validators that are incentivized to maintain the integrity of the
underlying ecological data and credits tracked on the ledger. Regen
Network believes this is the best way to maintain long term data
integrity, auditability, transparency, and viability, and enables a just

schemesfootnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading#Trading_systems[[.underline]#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading#Trading_systems#]]
as a method for offsetting carbon emissions. Regen Registry is not a
regulated emission trading scheme, but instead provides buyers a way to
voluntarily offset their carbon footprint.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Credits can only be retired once. Once a credit has been retired, it
cannot be transferred or sold anymore.
____
. {blank}
+

the project location, monitoring reports, and other pertinent data which
is made publicly available on Regen Registry. Buyers must indicate the
owner of the beneficial interest in the GHG mitigation claim for each
credit they retire.
____

=== *Tradability* 

[arabic, start=47]
. {blank}
+
____
Credit buyers will have the option to sell their credits so long as they
have not yet been retired. Credits are treated as commodities, not as
securities. RND is committed to comply with all relevant regulatory
frameworks, both in the US and internationally. In the future,
additional functionality to support secondary market trading will be
added.
____

=== *Aggregate Projects* 

[arabic, start=48]
. {blank}
+
____
Project Proponents may be able to create efficiencies around reporting
and verification by strategically combining a group of project areas
participating in an Aggregate Project. To that end, project areas should
be grouped so their defining characteristics are as homogeneous as
possible. Verifiers may select randomly which project areas will receive
on-site visits, or apply a risk analysis to identify project areas with
the strongest influence over an Aggregate Project’s outcomes. Verifiers
can use their own discretion to determine the data sampling approach,
yet all sites require at least a desk-based review.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Sites must have similar soil types and be located within the same
pre-defined geographic region, following the ecosystem types as outlined
in the Taxonomy Document.
____

____

=== *Additionality* 

____
The concept of additionality is often raised as a vital consideration
for quantifying project-based GHG reductions. Additionality is a
criteria that requires GHG reductions to only be recognized for project
activities that would not have “happened anyway.”

While there is general agreement that additionality is important, its
meaning and application remain difficult to define, frequently framed
with imprecise language, and in many cases subject to
interpretation.footnote:[https://ghginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AdditionalityPaper_Part-1ver3FINAL.pdf[[.underline]#https://ghginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AdditionalityPaper_Part-1ver3FINAL.pdf#]]

Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, a multi-stakeholder partnership of
businesses,

NGOs, governments, and academics convened by the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Resources Institute
(WRI), does not require demonstration of additionality, but instead
recommends incorporating it as an implicit part of the procedures used
to estimate baseline
emissionsfootnote:[https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg_project_accounting.pdf[[.underline]#https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg_project_accounting.pdf#]].
Depending on the methodology, as appropriate for each context, this may
be either a performance-based approach or a project-based approach,
using either a static or a dynamic baseline, and takes into account
different considerations and barriers to adoption.

Each Credit Class shall stipulate the relevant additionality
requirements to that credit.
____

=== *Permanence* 

____
In GHG accounting, permanence refers to the risk that a carbon reservoir
may be subject to gradual long-term or sudden disruptive release that
will reverse the benefit that occurred as a result of project
implementation. GHG emissions reductions from terrestrial sources and
sinks may not be permanent if a project has exposure to risk factors
such as intentional or unintentional events that result in emissions
into the atmosphere of sequestered CO2e for which offset credits were
issued. Terrestrial projects have the potential for GHG removals to be
reversed upon exposure to risk factors, including both unintentional
reversals (e.g. fire, flood, and insect infestation) and intentional
reversals (e.g., landowners choosing to discontinue land management
and/or participate in an activity that reverses the
sequestration).footnote:[https://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/american-carbon-registry-standard-3/acr-standard-v6-0-may-2019-public-comment-version.pdf[[.underline]#https://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/american-carbon-registry-standard-3/acr-standard-v6-0-may-2019-public-comment-version.pdf#]]

Land use-based and forestry projects may require the Project Proponent
to register covenants on their land and/or restrict land use for 40 to
100 years post credit

This approach is not financially viable for most Project Proponents as
the covenant often results in a reduction in the market value of the
land that is greater than the potential additional revenues from credit
sales.

Further, there is no length of time, short of perpetual, that is equated
with the assurance of permanence, nor is there a sound scientific basis
or accepted international standard around any number of years that
equates to an emission reduction/removal being permanent.

found to create substantial leakage across multiple projects, Regen
Registry will remove those activities from the approved list of
practices.
____

=== *Avoiding Double Counting*

____
Double counting refers to situations where a single GHG emission
reduction or removal is used more than once to demonstrate achievement
of mitigation targets and/or pledges typically made by
corporations/entities and countries. Double counting can occur either as
double issuance, double sale, or double claiming.

Double claiming is of concern in international carbon trading and in
determining Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris
Agreementfootnote:[https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement[[.underline]#https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement#]],
when an emission reduction is counted once by the country of origin when
reporting its emissions inventory, and again by the receiving country
(or other entity) when justifying emissions above its pledged climate
effort. In the absence of rules, a country of origin could reduce
emissions to meet its pledged effort and transfer those to a recipient;
the recipient could then claim those same reductions to meet its pledged
effort. In that case, only one reduction has actually occurred, but it
is being claimed twice. Analyses indicate that such double-claiming
could eliminate the entire climate benefit of all the
NDCs.footnote:[https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/double-counting-handbook.pdf[[.underline]#https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/double-counting-handbook.pdf#]]

Regen Registry has program rules and operational processes to mitigate
these double counting risks. To avoid double claiming, all credits will
be tracked on Regen Ledger, a custom-built ecological ledger leveraging
blockchain technology (specifically the Cosmos
SDKfootnote:[https://cosmos.network/[[.underline]#https://cosmos.network/#]]),
which provides public immutable records for transactions. The data on
Regen Ledger is available for external scrutiny and validation and
provides a digital audit trail for transactions, at any given point in
time. Examples include who was issued credits and their location, who
currently owns credits, when each credit was retired, and who claimed
the GHG benefit and their location.

on Climate Change
(UNFCCC)footnote:[https://unfccc.int/[[.underline]#https://unfccc.int/#]]
and Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
(CORSIA)footnote:[https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx[[.underline]#https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx#]]
to prevent double counting towards NDC and CORSIA obligations
respectively, and to ensure the environmental integrity of emissions
reductions.

== Verification

____
This section provides a general overview of the requirements for ex post
verification of GHG and Co-Benefits assertions by an independent
third-party verifier approved by Regen Registry.

As defined in this section, verification will be conducted by an
independent verifier chosen by the Project Proponent and approved by
Regen Registry.

Regen Registry seeks a balance between adequate assurances, the
overhead, and costs associated with verification. Therefore, each Credit
Class can stipulate the requirements that are best suited to the
ecosystem, best management practice and/or locale(s) it pertains to.
Regen Registry retains the right to adapt the requirements and provide
verification templates/interfaces as needed.
____

=== *Definitions*

[arabic, start=12]

. {blank}
+
____
Verification is the systematic, independent, and documented assessment
by a qualified ,impartial third-party of the GHG and Co-Benefits
assertion for a specific reporting period.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Regen Registry does not require an ex-ante GHG estimate in the Project
Plan and therefore validation is not necessary. Instead, the verifier
validates the project eligibility according to the rules defined in the
Program Guide, Credit Class and the Approved Methodology. Regen Registry
has simplified the eligibility requirements and considers verification
an applicable standard. However, each Credit Class can customize the
requirements as needed and add validation.

____
Regen Registry aims to democratize and invigorate the design of
ecosystem service credits. To that end we are separating out the typical
set of definitions that are part and parcel of most registry standards
and allow Credit Designers to modify and upgrade these as needed and
appropriate. These include:
____

* {blank}
+
____
Credit definition
____
* {blank}
+
____

____
GHG accounting related requirements including permanence, leakage and
additionality.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Verification requirements
____
* {blank}
+
____
Reporting and compliance requirements
____

____
The Registry Program Guide and the Credit Class templates provide the
guidelines for creating new credits, thus enabling innovation while
maintaining a high standard of rigor.

While a subset of Credit Classes might be developed by RND, the
intention is to build a vibrant community of Credit Designers that will
take the lead going forward.

Regen Registry aims to create a broad set of Credit Classes that cover
different ecosystems, geographical regions and localities, and are
tailored for different stakeholders (e.g. smallholder farmers, corporate
farms, indigineous communities, conservation organizations, etc).

One of our key assumptions is that creating a one-size-fits-all solution
is suboptimal and does not tap into collective potential. Ecological
systems are inherently complex. Regenerative farming, grazing ,and
conservation are complex, nuanced, and locale specific. Similarly, the
needs and risk profile of credit buyers vary substantially depending on
the size of the company, its sector, climate goals, etc. As such, we
believe a successful solution needs to leverage commonalities and best
practices, while simultaneously allowing for flexibility in design.
____

=== *New Credit Classes*

____

== Co-Benefits 

[arabic]
. {blank}
+
____
Introduction
____

____
Co-benefits of climate change mitigation, as defined in the 4th
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), are the positive benefits related to the reduction of GHG.
Examples of such climate mitigation policies include improved energy
efficiency of plants, renewable energy uptake and fuel switching, which
might enable a range of co-benefits, such as air-pollution impacts,
technological innovation, energy-supply security through increased
energy diversity, reduced fuel cost, and employment possibilities.

In the context of AFOLU projects, a variety of co-benefits are possible
including environmental, social, economic, indigineous rights, and many
more.

Interlinked with co-benefits is the shared blueprint the UN adopted in
2015 for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. At its heart
are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs)footnote:[https://sdgs.un.org/goals[[.underline]#https://sdgs.un.org/goals#]],
which are an urgent call for action by all countries in a global
partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations
must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education,
reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate
change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.
____

[arabic, start=2]
. {blank}
+
____
Credit Class requirements
____

____
Regen Registry is encouraging Credit Developers to include co-benefits
in all Credit Classes. This applies to both GHG removal credits and
other types of credits (e.g. biodiversity). In that sense we hold the
“co-benefit” term loosely in the sense that all benefits are important,
whether they are tied directly to climate change mitigation and GHG
removal or not.

Therefore, each Credit Class shall identify the applicable co-benefits
and how to measure and verify them. To that end, Regen Registry will
introduce in the future a framework and/or taxonomy to help Credit
Developers identify co-benefits and SDGs related to certain types of
projects, and stipulate how to measure and verify them. These
co-benefits and SDGs will be shown on Regen Registry to highlight the
broader impact of each project.
