Introduction
------------

   Every day, business is done while neglecting some of our most
   important partners: Farmers and the Earth. The result are destructive
   global consequences like climate change, desertification, and
   resource depletion that affect nearly every aspect of human life. The
   United Nations FAO estimates :mark:`33% of the Earth's soils are
   already degraded and over 90% could become degraded by
   2050` [8]_:mark:`.`

   The price tag to ‘fix’ these problems is estimated to be in the
   trillions, paralyzing global efforts to quickly address climate
   change. There may be nothing of more critical importance today than
   the regeneration of the world’s ecosystems.

   Farmers, the stewards of our global landscapes, offer one of the most
   powerful pathways for reversing climate change and unlocking a
   massive untapped market in the world: the services and products
   generated by Earth’s ecosystems. Regen Registry coupled with Regen
   Ledger, an ecological blockchain-based ledger, create a new platform
   for farmers to monetize their ecological data while receiving rewards
   for sustainable practices. By improving the understanding of the
   state of our land, oceans, and watersheds and enabling rewards for
   verified positive changes, Regen Network catalyzes the regeneration
   of our ecosystems.

   Regen Network was launched in Q2, 2018 and is headquartered in Great
   Barrington, Massachusetts.

Overview
--------

   The Program Guide details the general requirements and specifications
   for the quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV),
   project registration, and issuance of credits on Regen Registry. The
   common characteristic of all Regen Registry credits is that they are
   all nature-based solutions, and each can provide one or more
   ecosystem services, including GHG emissions reductions and removals,
   biodiversity/habitat protection, improvement in water quality, and
   more [9]_.

   The Program Guide establishes the programmatic structure of Regen
   Registry, including credit classes and methodologies, the project
   registration process, project eligibility, and the issuance of
   tradable environmental assets to projects. This guide is intended to
   be used by Project Proponents, buyers, Monitors, Verifiers, and all
   other stakeholders.

   Regen Registry aims to maximize flexibility and usability for Project
   Proponents while maintaining the environmental integrity and
   scientific rigor necessary to ensure that projects developed against
   its credit classes and methodologies are of the highest quality.

   Project Proponents developing a project for registration on Regen
   Registry shall follow this Program Guide and must apply a Regen
   Registry approved credit class and methodology.

   Project Proponents and other interested stakeholders should refer to
   the Regen Registry website for the latest version of the Program
   Guide, methodologies, document templates, and other guidance. Regen
   Registry will inform Project Proponents with active projects directly
   to avoid any potential disruptions.

Basics
------

1. Description

..

   Regen Registry is an open source ecosystem services registry in which
   Project Proponents can register projects, apply for credits, and
   transfer and sell credits to buyers. Buyers can resell or retire
   credits (in the case of carbon credits). Each credit vintage issued
   has a unique ID, is project-based, is geospatially tagged and
   independently verified [10]_.

   Regen Registry aims to provide an open source, vertically integrated
   solution that provides:

   a) Digital MRV - software infrastructure that provides monitoring
   tools - through in-house remote sensing and interoperability with 3rd
   party tools - that streamline the cost and issuance of credits.

   b) Marketing platform - showcases the unique story of each project,
   highlighting the land stewards, the impact on the land and
   environment; provides buyers and policy makers with impact analytics
   on a portfolio (regional, national, and global) of key ecological
   indicators.

   c) Marketplace and exchange (trading platform) - sellers offer their
   credits for sale; buyers purchase from one or multiple projects and
   build a portfolio; the system provides a clearing :mark:`and
   settlement infrastructure including` payments and billing.

   d) Regen Ledger - a custom-built ecological ledger using blockchain
   technology where credits are issued and transferred, and monitoring
   and verification claims are recorded as immutable records.

   Each layer offered within the Regen Registry is standalone and
   Project Proponents can choose which ones to use. For example, a
   Project Proponent can choose to perform the monitoring in-house,
   based on the methodology guidelines, rather than use a Monitor that
   leverages our software stack. That said, integrated use of all layers
   will enable significant advantages in ease-of-use, effectiveness, and
   cost efficiency.

2. Objectives

..

   Regen Registry’s objectives are to:

-  Encourage nature-based solutions. For example, solutions based on
      regenerative agriculture, conservation, and best management
      practices, as a strategy to mitigate (by removing/reducing GHG
      emissions) and/or adapt to climate change.

-  Provide guidance for, and promote, scientifically rigorous
      methodologies and credit classes to foster high quality ecological
      assets.

-  Create an open-source infrastructure that allows cost-effective and
      rigorous MRV implementation, issues and tracks credits while
      avoiding double counting, and provides payments, billing, and
      marketing functionality.

-  Support best practices in project-level GHG accounting and ecosystem
      services.

-  Commercialize innovative types of credits bundled with valuable
      co-benefits and ecosystem services.

-  Provide an environment to develop new types of ecological assets that
      will inform voluntary and regulated markets.

-  Incorporate cutting-edge technologies, such as IoT sensors, satellite
      remote sensing, and digital signatures, in the use of project
      monitoring and verification.

-  Enhance public confidence in market-based action for GHG removal and
      ecosystems’ regeneration.

-  Support interoperability between climate markets emerging from the
      UNFCCC’s Paris Agreement and global NDC commitments.

   1. Scope

      1. Geography

..

   Regen Registry accepts projects from locations worldwide, provided
   they conform to an approved credit class and its respective
   methodology.

2. Project Types

..

   Regen Registry encourages and accepts a broad variety of nature-based
   projects that promote climate mitigation, adaptation, and
   regeneration of ecosystems, such as:

-  Agricultural projects - examples include the adoption of cropland
      practices that sequester carbon, such as reduced tillage or
      planting cover crops, or pastureland / rangeland practices, such
      as rotational grazing.

-  Water management projects - examples include the installation of
      swales that reduce nutrient runoff.

-  Forestry projects - examples include afforestation, reforestation,
      and agroforestry projects.

   1. Users

..

   The following depicts the main users of Regen Registry:

-  Credit Designer - an individual or organization that is developing a
      new Credit Class or updating an existing Credit Class.

-  Methodology Developer - an individual or organization that is
      developing a new Methodology or updating an existing Methodology.

      or a third-party that rents the land to the Land Steward.

-  Buyer - an individual or organization that is purchasing credits from
      the Regen Registry.

   1. Adoption and Revisions

..

   Regen Registry aims to update the Program Guide on a yearly basis in
   order to accommodate changes in science and technology which inform
   new/upgraded methodologies, and changes in climate markets including
   GHG accounting best practices, legislative and/or regulatory
   requirements.

   On a project level and in certain circumstances, Regen Registry may
   require all projects, including those monitored and verified under a
   previous version of the Program Guide, to implement a policy or
   process revision (e.g., updated administrative reporting procedures)
   detailed in a subsequent version of the Program Guide.

   New/subsequent versions of the Program Guide will be posted for
   public comment for 30 days prior to adoption. Regen Registry will
   prepare responses to submitted comments and post the comments and
   responses along with the new version of the Program Guide.

2. Data Submission and Record-Keeping

..

   Where appropriate, Regen Registry will provide templates for Project
   Proponents to collect and submit data for project registration,
   monitoring, and verification. These templates will be updated as
   needed. In the future, templates will migrate to online/digital
   interfaces, including digital signatures that simplify data
   collection and processing, enable interoperability with 3rd party
   tools, and provide a digital audit trail.

3. Conflict of Interest

..

   Regen Registry requires that third-party Monitors and Verifiers sign
   a Conflict of Interest agreement.

Guiding Principles
------------------

4. Accuracy

..

   The Project Proponent shall reduce, as far as is practical,
   uncertainties related to the quantification of GHG removals and/or
   any other applicable ecological indicator, such as species habitat,
   tree coverage, etc.

   Methodologies submitted for Regen Registry approval shall include
   methods for estimating the uncertainty for each indicator. :mark:`If
   the width of the 90% confidence interval exceeds 20%, an appropriate
   confidence deduction shall be applied.`

   The use of models, such as biogeochemical models, must include an
   estimate of structural uncertainty related to the inadequacy of the
   model, model bias, and model discrepancy. Monitors shall quantify
   these using the best available science, Monte Carlo analyses,
   uncertainty estimates from peer reviewed literature, and/or
   consulting model experts who have either developed or worked directly
   with the model in an academic setting.

5. Comparability

..

   Methodologies approved on Regen Registry shall rely on comparable
   peer-reviewed studies as best as possible.

   Further, Regen Registry is building infrastructure for automated
   monitoring processes that will enable, once monitoring has been
   performed for a given project, to have an independent party run that
   same monitoring process again, at will, in order to compare the
   results. We believe this will provide a new level of transparency and
   assurance to monitoring processes.

6. Continuously and Frequently Upgraded

..

   Regen Registry encourages updates of the Program Guide, Credit
   Classes, and Methodologies in order to incorporate the latest
   scientific knowledge, technologies, and tools, such as IoT and remote
   sensing.

7. Transparency

..

   Regen Registry is built to provide stakeholders, including Project
   Proponents, Buyers, scientists, and market experts, with a high level
   of transparency. We achieve this by:

-  Credit Classes and Methodologies are publicly available and receive
      public comment. We also encourage engaging a broad set of subject
      matter experts during the design process.

-  All pertinent project data is publicly available, including the
      Project Plan, monitoring reports, credit issuance certification,
      and verification reports.

-  Regen Ledger will provide an immutable record and digital audit trail
      of monitoring and verification outcomes, and credit issuance and
      sales.

..

   See also the GHG Accounting and Policies section.

1. Collaboration

..

   Regen Registry believes deeply in collaboration. We are convening a
   broad set of independent parties to participate in:

-  Methodology development and Credit Class design - scientists,
      economists and subject matter experts are invited to create new,
      cutting-edge ecological assets, to provide feedback, and to govern
      the library of methodologies and credit classes.

-  Monitoring and verification - remote sensing companies, experts, IoT
      providers, surveying tools, etc. are invited to provide their
      monitoring services to streamline the costs of MRV while
      maintaining scientific rigor.

-  Regen Registry platform and Regen Ledger development - software
      developers who are eager to mitigate climate change are welcome to
      contribute to these open source projects.

..

   To that end, RND is also an active member OpenTEAM [11]_, or Open
   Technology Ecosystem for Agricultural Management, a farmer-driven,
   interoperable platform to provide farmers around the world with the
   best possible knowledge to improve soil health. We are currently
   collaborating with OpenTEAM members in creating digital, open source,
   and standardized data collection from the field and from MRV
   providers.

1. Practicality

..

   Regen Registry aims to balance the time and cost required by Project
   Proponents to collect data for monitoring, verification and reporting
   and the need for assurances from Credit Buyers. To that end, Regen
   Registry encourages a tiered approach to methodology development that
   will provide different levels of assurances to cater to different
   needs of Credit Buyers.

2. Security

..

   RND will conduct security audits of its software, including Regen
   Ledger and Regen Registry, to ensure the data integrity and fidelity
   of credit ownership and the underlying MRV data.

3. Open Source and Open Data

..

   Following the collaboration principle above, RND is a strong
   proponent of open-source software and open data. We firmly believe
   that in order to achieve the best results, provide transparency,
   ensure fair governance, and invite collaboration from multiple
   stakeholders, we need to develop open source software and share our
   research data openly. Our software code repositories are available on
   GitHub [12]_

4. User-Centric Design

..

   Relative to their potential, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
   (AFOLU) carbon credits have seen limited adoption in regulatory and
   voluntary markets. Historically, the supply of these credits has been
   limited because credit design has not incorporated enough feedback
   from land stewards, resulting in credit requirements that were
   complicated, expensive and/or time consuming. Regen Registry follows
   a user centric design of credit classes and methodologies with input
   not only from buyers but also land stewards and project developers.

Governance 
-----------

   Regen Registry is built on the principles of openness, collaboration,
   accountability, user centric design, transparency, responsiveness,
   and participation. This is applied to Credit Class and Methodology
   design, provision of monitoring and verification services,
   integration with other registries, and with 3rd-party service
   providers.

   Regen Registry relies on a software implementation that includes two
   layers: a) Regen Registry platform - a centralized software layer
   that provides user accounts, project pages, administrative functions
   and b) Regen Ledger [13]_ - a decentralized software layer that is
   used to issue, transfer, and retire credits and tracks all pertinent
   monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) information as immutable
   records.

   Regen Registry is operated by Regen Network Development, Inc (RND), a
   private for-profit company. Regen Ledger is a public decentralized
   ledger that is not owned by a single entity (including RND) and is a
   Digital Commons [14]_ that is operated by a network of independent
   stakeholders called Validators that are incentivized to maintain the
   integrity of the underlying ecological data and credits tracked on
   the ledger. Regen Network believes this is the best way to maintain
   long term data integrity, auditability, transparency, and viability,
   and enables a just allocation of resources and sustained regeneration
   of ecological ecosystems (see blog post [15]_ for more details).

   Regen Registry is committed to fully comply with all relevant U.S.
   Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities
   and Exchange Commission (SEC) standards and regulations.

   In the event that RND dissolves, the Regen Registry’s contractual
   agreements bind both project developers and buyers to uphold any
   outstanding contractual commitments as if the two slides are direct
   parties to the contracts.

Project eligibility
-------------------

**Ecosystem Type** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Each Credit Class and Methodology shall stipulate the Ecosystem Type
   based on RND taxonomy [16]_. In the event there is no matching
   definition in the taxonomy, the Credit Designer or Methodology
   Developer will propose an addition to the taxonomy.

**Ecosystem Service Classification**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Each Credit Class and Methodology shall stipulate the Ecosystem
   Service based on RND taxonomy [17]_. In the event there is no
   matching definition in the taxonomy, the Credit Designer or
   Methodology Developer will propose an addition to the taxonomy.

**Land Ownership Type**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Credit Class shall stipulate the land ownership type accepted, for
example:

-  Private

-  Public

-  Tribal

Or combination of the above.

**Adoption Date**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Adoption Date is the date on which the Project Proponent began to
   apply the Project Activity intended to increase a certain ecological
   outcome (e.g. carbon stock) relative to the baseline measurement.

   Each Credit Class shall define the earliest Adoption Date accepted
   for that credit, but no earlier than 10 years prior to Project
   Registration Date.

   The Project Proponent must provide evidence to that effect.

**Crediting Term**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Crediting Term is the finite length of time for which a Project Plan
   is valid, and during which a project can generate credits.

   Each Credit Class shall define the corresponding Crediting Term(s)
   available for that credit.

**GHG Removal/Emission Reduction Requirements** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Credit Classes that include GHG removals shall include these related
   requirements:

**Real**
~~~~~~~~

   A real offset is the result of a Project Activity that yields
   quantifiable and verifiable GHG removals as stipulated in the
   Approved Methodology.

**Measurable**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Each credit represents one ton CO\ :sub:`2`\ e (1t CO\ :sub:`2`\ e)
   that has been removed (or avoided) from the atmosphere.

**No Double Counting**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Regen Registry does not allow double issuing and selling of credits
   for the same project area and/or temporal boundary. See also
   ‘Registration on other registries’ section.

**Land Tenure** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Land tenure is a legal term representing rights and interests in
      project lands.

2. Project Proponent shall own, have control over, or document effective
      control over the GHG sources/sinks from which the removals
      originate.

3. Project Proponent shall provide documentation and/or attestation of
      land tenure.

4. In the case of leased land, the landowner shall agree to all
      contractual obligations taken by the Project Proponent, and the
      project Proponent shall provide documentation and/or attestation
      of title agreement to credits.

5. Regen Registry may require a legal review by an expert in local law.

**Regulatory Compliance** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

6. Projects must maintain material regulatory compliance, that is,
      adherent to all laws, regulations, and other legally binding
      mandates directly related to Project Activities.

7. Project Proponent is required to provide a regulatory compliance
      attestation for each verification. This attestation must disclose
      all violations or other instances of non-compliance with laws,
      regulations, or other legally binding mandates directly related to
      Project Activities.

8. Regen Registry retains discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis
      whether a violation requires cancelling the project or putting it
      on hold until the issue is addressed.

**Project Area**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

9.  The Project Area may only include land meeting the following
       requirements:

    1. The land was not converted from forest land, wetlands or any
          other natural ecosystem (see RND Taxonomy Document for
          definitions) in the 10 year period prior to the Project’s
          Adoption Date.

10. The Project Area may include portions of land which are not eligible
       land, only if they are excluded from any GHG or co-benefit
       estimation. Those areas will be clearly demarcated in the Project
       Plan.

**Registration on other registries**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

11. Project Proponent is required to state if they plan to apply in the
       future, or have applied for and been listed, registered, and/or
       been issued GHG emission reduction or removal credits,
       biodiversity credits or any other ecological credit through any
       other GHG emissions program, biodiversity program or any other
       certification program.

12. Project Proponent will include detailed information on any credit
       issuance (volume, vintage, status), and information on any
       rejections of the project application on other registries.

13. Regen Registry will review the information provided by Project
       Proponent and approve or reject concurrent registration with
       another registry(s). Regen Registry will permit concurrent
       project registration only if the following conditions are met:

    1. No double issuance - credits issued for the same unique emissions
          reductions (project boundary and vintage) do not reside
          concurrently on more than one registry.

    2. No double sale - once any credits have been sold on another
          registry, the Project Proponent will be required to cancel
          that project in order to register on Regen Registry.

..

   Note, these conditions hold, not only during project registration but
   throughout the lifetime of the project. That is, Project Proponent
   with an existing project on Regen Registry shall follow the same
   procedure above if planning to register on another registry
   concurrently.

   See Avoiding Double Counting section for more details.

Project Rules and Regulation
----------------------------

**Approved Methodology**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Each Credit Class shall define the Approved Methodology(s) which the
   credit relies upon.

**Project Plan** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Project Plan describes the Project Activity, addresses
   eligibility requirements, establishes project boundaries, and more.
   The Project Proponent shall fill out the Project Plan template [18]_
   and submit for review by Regen Registry.

**Project Lifecycle**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This is a general outline of the project stages:

14. Account Creation - Project Proponent provides contact information
       and creates an account on Regen Registry.

15. Project Creation - Project Proponent creates a project, applies for
       a credit, completes the Project Plan, and signs the corresponding
       legal agreements.

16. Preliminary Review - Regen Registry reviews the submission for
       completeness and compatibility with the Credit Class and Approved
       Methodology, and requests additional information as needed.

17. Project Registration - If everything is in order, the project is
       approved, the contract is signed between the Project Proponent
       and Regen Registry.

18. Baseline Measurement - Project Proponent engages with Monitor and
       provides the project information as defined in the Approved
       Methodology. The Monitor follows the guidelines in the Approved
       Methodology and generates a baseline measurement of the
       ecological indicators and benefit assessment assigned to the
       Credit Class. The Baseline Monitoring Report is submitted to
       Regen Registry. If the report is approved, it is made publicly
       available on Regen Registry.

19. Verification - Per the verification schedule defined in the Credit
       Class, the Project Proponent engages with an independent,
       approved Verifier to verify the inputs provided by the Project
       Proponent and the baseline and monitoring reports submitted by
       the Monitor follow the specification of the Approved Methodology.
       Fees for verification are determined by the Project Proponent and
       Verifier. The Verifier submits to Regen Registry a verified
       Project Plan, verified monitoring report(s), and verification
       report with verification rating (see Verification section for
       further details).

20. Verification Acceptance - Based on the verification report rating,
       Regen Registry issues credits to the Project Proponent. The
       verification report is made publicly available on Regen Registry.

21. Subsequent Monitoring and Verification rounds - Following the
       guidelines in the Approved Methodology and Credit Class,
       subsequent monitoring and verification rounds are performed, and
       the above steps repeat for each credit vintage issuance.

22. Issuance - Regen Registry issues to the Project Proponent’s account
       credits for the relevant reporting period, in the amount listed
       in the monitoring report.

23. Transfer or Retire - At the Project Proponent’s discretion, they can
       sell or retire the credits.

24. Final Project Verification - At the end of the Crediting Term, the
       Project Proponent will engage in a final project verification.
       The report will be made public on Regen Registry.

25. Project Renewal (optional) - After the final project verification,
       the Project Proponent can elect to renew the project. The
       duration for renewal is defined by each Credit Class.

GHG removal projects’ specific adaptations:

26. Credit issuance - With each issuance, a percentage of credits, as
       defined in the Credit Class, is deposited into the Buffer Pool.

27. Buffer pool reconciliation - Based on the end-of-project carbon
       stock estimation, Regen Registry will retire or transfer credits
       from the Buffer Pool. See the Buffer Pool section.

28. Permanence Monitoring and Verification - At the end of the
       permanence period, the Project Proponent will conduct a
       permanence monitoring and verification round (desk review) in
       order to verify retention of GHG removed during the project.

**Project Ownership**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Project Proponent shall stipulate the ownership of credits issued to
   the project. Regen Registry supports fractional ownership of the
   credits allocated to a project in a given issuance event, therefore
   credits can be split between Land Stewards, Land Owners, Project
   Developers, and Buyers.

**Project Registration Date**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

29. The Project Registration Date is the date the Project has been
       approved by Regen Registry. The Crediting Term officially begins
       on this date.

30. If an Adoption Date precedes the Project Registration Date, the
       Crediting Term will commence at the Project Initial Monitoring
       Date as defined by the Approved Methodology.

**Project Renewal** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

31. At the end of the project, the Project Proponent can elect to renew
       the project. The Project Proponent may do so by:

    1. Choosing from these renewal period options: 5, 10, 15 or 20
          years.

    2. Submitting an updated Project Plan in compliance with up-to-date
          Credit Class and Approved Methodology.

32. The final project monitoring and verification round of carbon stock
       and/or other ecological indicator estimates will be automatically
       used as the renewal up-to-date baseline.

33. Project Proponents may renew a project multiple times. Regen
       Registry does not limit the number of periods of renewal that are
       allowed for a given project renewals.

**Project Monitoring Reports**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

34. Project Monitoring Reports shall be completed for each monitoring
       period following the template for Project Monitoring Report. The
       Monitor shall submit the report to Regen Registry including any
       corrections/revisions identified by the verifier (if applicable).

35. The Monitoring Report shall describe the current status of project
       operation, and include the data monitored, the monitoring plan,
       the calculated emission reductions and ecological indicators for
       the reporting period stated in the Credit Class and following the
       guidelines in the Approved Methodology.

**Project Termination**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

36. End of Project Termination

    1. At the end of the Crediting Term, the Project Proponent will
          engage in a final project verification. The report will be
          made public on Regen Registry.

    2. The Project Proponent has the choice to renew the project
          (renewal duration stipulated in Credit class).

    3. In the case of a GHG removal credit, based on the end of project
          carbon stock estimation, Regen Registry will retire or issue
          credits from the Buffer Pool. See the Buffer Pool section for
          more details.

Premature Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4. Prior to credit sales transactions (i.e. sold, transferred, or
      retired), a Project Proponent can decide to end the project
      prematurely with no penalties.

5. Regen Registry fees will still apply, along with any outstanding
      obligations between Project Proponent and 3rd parties, such as
      Verifiers and/or Monitors.

6. In the case of a GHG removal credit:

   1. Before credit sales transactions, project credits in the Project
         Proponent’s account will be cancelled including the respective
         Buffer Pool and Permanence Reversal Buffer allocations.

   2. After credit sales transactions, the Project Proponent:

      1. Shall engage with a final monitoring and verification round to
            calculate the carbon stock levels and determine Buffer Pool
            allocations and/or further compensation required. See the
            Buffer Pool section for more details. If the Project
            Proponent fails to engage with a final monitoring and
            verification round, the project will be deemed to be
            non-compliant.

      2. Comply with permanence requirements of the vintage that was
            sold.

**Project On Hold** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

37. A project may be put on hold if:

    1. Project Proponent fails to comply with the reporting requirements
          stated in Credit Class and the Approved Methodology.

    2. A Verification Report is submitted with a Rejection rating.

    3. In the case of a GHG removal credit, an intentional reversal of
          carbon stock is identified.

38. A project in on hold status will not be issued credits until the
       identified issues are resolved.

39. The Project Proponent will be allowed 60 days to remedy the fault
       found or the project will be deemed non-compliant. Regen Registry
       may require an additional monitoring and verification round after
       the fault has been remedied.

**Non-Compliant Projects** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

40. Projects that are non-compliant include the following cases:

    1. In the event that a project was put on-hold and the Project
          Proponent did not comply with Regen Registry requests within
          sixty days.

    2. The Project Proponent cancelled the project prematurely and did
          not comply with final monitoring and verification round
          requirements.

41. These cases will be seen as a breach of contract, subject to dispute
       resolution as stipulated in the legal contracts. If the dispute
       is not resolved, the project will be cancelled from the registry
       and all issued credits remaining in Project Proponent’s account
       along with the project credits allocated to Buffer Pool and
       Permanence Reversal Buffer (if applicable) will be cancelled.

42. Non-compliant projects will be delisted from Regen Registry and,
       depending on the case, at RND discretion, the Project Proponent
       might be restricted from listing any future projects on Regen
       Registry.

**Retiring Credits**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In the case of a GHG removal credit:

43. Traditionally in carbon markets, credit retirement involves
       allowances from regulated emission trading schemes [19]_ as a
       method for offsetting carbon emissions. Regen Registry is not a
       regulated emission trading scheme, but instead provides buyers a
       way to voluntarily offset their carbon footprint.

44. Credits can only be retired once. Once a credit has been retired, it
       cannot be transferred or sold anymore.

45. Regen Registry provides the ability for buyers to trade their
       credits, i.e. sell them to other buyers on a secondary market. In
       the future, a secondary marketplace functionality will be added.

46. Credit buyers will have access to the Project Proponent’s
       information, the project location, monitoring reports, and other
       pertinent data which is made publicly available on Regen
       Registry. Buyers must indicate the owner of the beneficial
       interest in the GHG mitigation claim for each credit they retire.

**Tradability** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

47. Credit buyers will have the option to sell their credits so long as
       they have not yet been retired. Credits are treated as
       commodities, not as securities. RND is committed to comply with
       all relevant regulatory frameworks, both in the US and
       internationally. In the future, additional functionality to
       support secondary market trading will be added.

**Aggregate Projects** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

48. Project Proponents may be able to create efficiencies around
       reporting and verification by strategically combining a group of
       project areas participating in an Aggregate Project. To that end,
       project areas should be grouped so their defining characteristics
       are as homogeneous as possible. Verifiers may select randomly
       which project areas will receive on-site visits, or apply a risk
       analysis to identify project areas with the strongest influence
       over an Aggregate Project’s outcomes. Verifiers can use their own
       discretion to determine the data sampling approach, yet all sites
       require at least a desk-based review.

49. Sites must have similar soil types and be located within the same
       pre-defined geographic region, following the ecosystem types as
       outlined in the Taxonomy Document.

**Personal / Commercially Sensitive Information**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

50. Project Proponents may request to designate portions of the Project
       Plan or project documentation as Personal / Commercially
       Sensitive Information. This information must be available for
       review by Regen Registry and the approved Verifier (with
       non-disclosure agreements, as necessary), but will not be posted
       publicly as part of the project documentation on Regen Registry.
       This information will be restricted to these Project Plan items:

    1. Entity name and contact information

    2. Land tenure

    3. Land ownership type

51. To promote transparency, Regen Registry shall presume by default all
       project information to be available for public scrutiny, unless
       requested otherwise by the Project Proponent.

**Previous Rejection by Other Registry**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

52. Regen Registry may consider a project rejected by other registries,
       due to

..

   procedural or eligibility requirements, if the project complies with
   the Credit Class and Approved Methodology. The Project Proponent for
   such a project shall include a statement in the Project Plan that
   lists all other programs to which the Project Proponent has applied
   for registration and was rejected, the reason(s) for the rejection,
   and pertinent documentation.

**Managing Property Under Covenance Obligation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

53. Project Proponents that choose to put their land under permanence
       convenance are required to inform prospective buyers of any
       permanence obligations associated with the land when selling
       their property.

GHG Removal and Emission Reduction Requirements
-----------------------------------------------

   The following requirements apply to GHG removal and emission
   reduction credits issued on Regen Registry.

**GHG Accounting and Policies**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

54. Guiding principles for GHG Accounting

    1. In defining this Program Guide, RND has attempted to follow the
          best practices as applied to carbon credit markets and
          Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) carbon
          credits.

    2. The core GHG accounting principles laid out in ISO 14064 Part
          2:2019 [20]_ have informed this guide and are summarized
          below:

+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|                 |    Select the GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs    |
|   **Relevance** |    (SSRs), data and methodologies appropriate to   |
|                 |    the needs of the intended user.                 |
+=================+====================================================+
|    *            |    Include all relevant GHG emissions and          |
| *Completeness** |    removals. Include all relevant information to   |
|                 |    support criteria and procedures.                |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|                 |    Enable meaningful comparisons in GHG-related    |
| **Consistency** |    information.                                    |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|    **Accuracy** |    Reduce bias and uncertainties as far as is      |
|                 |    practical.                                      |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|    *            |    Disclose sufficient and appropriate GHG-related |
| *Transparency** |    information to                                  |
|                 |                                                    |
|                 |    allow intended users to make decisions with     |
|                 |    reasonable confidence.                          |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|    **Con        |    Use conservative assumptions, values, and       |
| servativeness** |    procedures to ensure                            |
|                 |                                                    |
|                 |    that GHG emission reductions or removal         |
|                 |    enhancements                                    |
|                 |                                                    |
|                 |    are not overestimated.                          |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+

55. Adherence to GHG Accounting principles

    1.  Boundary Selection

        1. GHG project boundaries include a project’s physical boundary
              and implementation area (i.e. where the Project Activity
              takes place), the GHG sources, sinks, reservoirs (SSRs)
              considered, and the project duration.

        2. The Approved Methodology establishes the criteria for the
              selection of relevant GHG SSRs, and procedures for
              quantifying GHG emissions.

        3. The Project Proponent shall provide maps, Geographic
              Information System (GIS) shapefiles, and other relevant
              information to delineate the project physical boundary.

    2.  Relevance and Completeness

        1. Project Proponent shall consider all relevant information
              that may affect the accounting and quantification of GHG
              emissions or reductions including all relevant SSRs.

        2. The Program Guide and Credit Class include mechanisms to
              account for estimation uncertainty and carbon retention
              risk. See the Buffer Pool and Permanence sections for more
              details.

    3.  Consistency

        1. The assumptions, methods, and data used in the Approved
              Methodology to quantify GHG reductions and removals rely
              on peer reviewed data that enables meaningful comparisons
              to other methods and data.

    4.  Accuracy

        1. The Project Proponent shall reduce, as far as is practical,
              uncertainties related to the quantification of GHG
              emission reductions or removal enhancements.

        2. This Program Guide and Credit Class require that the sampling
              error associated with the mean of the estimated emission
              reduction/removal not exceed ±20% of the mean at the 90%
              confidence interval to report the mean of the estimated
              emission reduction/removal. If the Project Proponent
              cannot meet this target, then an uncertainty deduction is
              required as specified by the Approved Methodology.

    5.  Transparency

    6.  The Approved Methodology, Credit Class and Program Guide
           disclose sufficient and appropriate GHG-related information
           to allow all intended users to make decisions with reasonable
           confidence.

    7.  Regen Registry is built to provide public access to all key
           pertinent information related to GHG estimations such as
           project monitoring and verification reports.

    8.  Conservativeness

    9.  The Approved Methodology shall define assumptions and specify
           quantification methods and monitoring requirements to ensure
           that GHG emission reductions and removals are not
           overestimated.

    10. Emission Reduction / Removal Factors

    11. When estimating GHG emission reductions or removals,
           methodologies shall specify GHG emissions or removal factors
           that are:

-  Derived from a scientific peer-reviewed source

-  Appropriate for the GHG source or sink concerned

-  Account for uncertainty in the quantification method

   1. Independently Verified

   2. The baseline report, monitoring reports, and Project Plan are
         validated by a Regen Registry approved verifier (unless
         otherwise stipulated in the Credit Class).

   3. Managing Data Quality

   4. The Monitor shall follow the guidelines in the Approved
         Methodology and establish quality assurance and quality control
         (QA/QC) procedures to manage data and information, including
         the assessment of uncertainty in the baseline and ongoing
         monitoring.

**Additionality** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The concept of additionality is often raised as a vital consideration
   for quantifying project-based GHG reductions. Additionality is a
   criteria that requires GHG reductions to only be recognized for
   project activities that would not have “happened anyway.”

   While there is general agreement that additionality is important, its
   meaning and application remain difficult to define, frequently framed
   with imprecise language, and in many cases subject to
   interpretation. [21]_

   Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, a multi-stakeholder partnership
   of businesses,

   NGOs, governments, and academics convened by the World Business
   Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Resources
   Institute (WRI), does not require demonstration of additionality, but
   instead recommends incorporating it as an implicit part of the
   procedures used to estimate baseline emissions [22]_. Depending on
   the methodology, as appropriate for each context, this may be either
   a performance-based approach or a project-based approach, using
   either a static or a dynamic baseline, and takes into account
   different considerations and barriers to adoption.

   Each Credit Class shall stipulate the relevant additionality
   requirements to that credit.

**Permanence** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In GHG accounting, permanence refers to the risk that a carbon
   reservoir may be subject to gradual long-term or sudden disruptive
   release that will reverse the benefit that occurred as a result of
   project implementation. GHG emissions reductions from terrestrial
   sources and sinks may not be permanent if a project has exposure to
   risk factors such as intentional or unintentional events that result
   in emissions into the atmosphere of sequestered CO2e for which offset
   credits were issued. Terrestrial projects have the potential for GHG
   removals to be reversed upon exposure to risk factors, including both
   unintentional reversals (e.g. fire, flood, and insect infestation)
   and intentional reversals (e.g., landowners choosing to discontinue
   land management and/or participate in an activity that reverses the
   sequestration). [23]_

   Land use-based and forestry projects may require the Project
   Proponent to register covenants on their land and/or restrict land
   use for 40 to 100 years post credit issuance [24]_. This approach is
   not financially viable for most Project Proponents as the covenant
   often results in a reduction in the market value of the land that is
   greater than the potential additional revenues from credit sales.

   Further, there is no length of time, short of perpetual, that is
   equated with the assurance of permanence, nor is there a sound
   scientific basis or accepted international standard around any number
   of years that equates to an emission reduction/removal being
   permanent.

1. Regen Registry requires by default a 25-year permanence period. The
      Project Proponent is provided two options as it relates to
      permanence assurances:

   1. Allocate an additional 5% of each credit issuance (in addition to
         the Buffer Pool) to a dedicated Permanence Reversal Buffer.

   2. Register a covenant on the land from the Project Registration
         until the end of the 25-year permanence period.

The Project Proponent states their choice in the Project Plan.

2. If the project is renewed, the Project Proponent will choose again a
      permanence assurance for the renewed project.

3. If the Project Proponent chooses the Permanence Reversal Buffer, at
      the end of the permanence period (25 years from the end of the
      Crediting Term), the Project Proponent will conduct a permanence
      monitoring and verification (desk verification suffices) round in
      order to verify carbon retention. See Permanence Reversal Buffer
      section for more details.

4. Each Credit Class can create alternative permanence requirements as
      appropriate.

**Buffer Pool**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. 

..

   Carbon sequestration projects have the potential for GHG removals to
   be reversed unintentionally or overestimated. The Buffer Pool serves
   as a tool to mitigate the general and project-specific risk factors,
   including the overall uncertainty risk in GHG estimations (on top of
   the portion accounted for already by the Approved Methodology).

1. Buffer Pool Account

   1. Regen Registry will establish a dedicated account, over which it
         has sole operational and management control, that serves to
         hold the Buffer Pool contributions from each project. Project
         Proponents may not sell, transfer, retire, or dispose of
         credits that are held within the Buffer Pool Account.

2. Buffer Pool Contribution

   1. Regen Registry will apply a default contribution of 20% of each
         credit issuance (as quantified by the latest monitoring report)
         to the Buffer Pool in order to account for the risks mentioned
         above.

..

   Each Credit Class can override this allocation as appropriate.

2. The credits will be automatically deposited into the dedicated
      administrative Buffer Pool Account.

3. End of Crediting Term Processing

   1. Upon the completion of the project and the final monitoring and
         verification, the Buffer Pool will be reconciled according to
         the end of project carbon stock level:

      1. If the final project carbon stock level was above the level
            reported in prior monitoring and verification round:

         1. The existing credit balance of Buffer Pool will be issued to
               Project Proponent.

         2. 10% of credits (instead of the normal 20%) in the final
               issuance will be allocated back to the Buffer Pool in
               order to account for any uncertainty of estimation in the
               last monitoring round.

      2. If the final project carbon stock level was below the level
            reported in prior verification:

         1. The gap will be withdrawn from the Buffer Pool and
               immediately retired. The remainder of the Buffer Pool
               minus 10% will be distributed to the Project Proponent.

         2. If the Buffer Pool balance does not cover the gap, the
               Project Proponent will have the following options to
               compensate for the carbon stock loss:

   -  Renew the project and defer the payment to the next issuance(s).

   -  Use non-transacted (sold) credit/other credits in Project
         Proponent’s Regen Registry account.

   -  Purchase credits to compensate for the carbon loss.

4. Premature Project Ending Process

   1. In the event that the project has ended prematurely, Regen
         Registry will follow a conservative approach and automatically
         retire all the credits in the Buffer Pool associated with the
         project.

   2. In a final verification report, where the end of project carbon
         stock level is available, similarly to ‘End of Crediting Term
         Processing’, if the Buffer Pool was insufficient to cover the
         gap in carbon stocks level then the Project Proponent will be
         required to purchase credits to compensate for the carbon loss.

   3. If no final verification report is available, to be conservative,
         Regen Registry will assume a default loss of 10% in carbon
         stock level from prior levels and retire credits accordingly.
         If the Buffer Pool was insufficient to cover that loss, the
         Project Proponent will be required to purchase credits to
         compensate for the carbon loss.

5. Overestimation of credits issued during the Crediting Term

   1. In the event that during the Crediting Term a verification report
         rating was Rejection on the grounds that the carbon stock level
         was overestimated, then:

      1. The gap will be withdrawn from the Buffer Pool and immediately
            retired.

      2. If the Buffer Pool balance does not cover the gap, the Project
            Proponent will have the following options to compensate for
            the carbon stock loss:

   -  Use non-transacted (sold) credit/other credits in Project
         Proponent’s Regen Registry account.

   -  Purchase credits to compensate for the carbon loss.

6. Purchase of credits to compensate for carbon loss

   1. In any event, per above, that the Project Proponent is required to
         purchase credits to compensate for carbon loss, these credits
         shall be from other like projects with similar regional
         characteristics and co-benefits, either from Regen Registry or
         from Established Registries.

**Permanence Reversal Buffer**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Project Proponents can choose to use a Permanence Reversal Buffer to
   mitigate permanence-related reversal risk, i.e. GHG removal reversal
   that has occurred over the permanence period.

7.  Permanence Reversal Buffer Account

    1. Regen Registry will establish a dedicated account, over which it
          has sole operational and management control, that serves to
          hold the Permanence Reversal Buffer contributions from each
          project. Project Proponent may not transfer, retire, or
          dispose of credits that are held within the Permanence
          Reversal Buffer.

8.  Permanence Reversal Buffer Contribution

    1. In the event that Project Proponents choose to use the Permanence
          Reversal Buffer, Regen Registry will apply a default
          contribution of 5% of each credit issuance (as quantified by
          the latest monitoring report) in order to account for the risk
          of reversal during the permanence period.

    2. In the event the Project Proponents choose not to use the
          Permanence Reversal Buffer and use other alternatives such as
          long term covenants, the 5% will not be deducted from each
          credit issuance.

9.  End of Permanence Period

    1. Upon the completion of the permanence period an additional
          monitoring and verification round will occur and the
          Permanence Reversal Buffer will be reconciled with the carbon
          stock level at the last recorded monitoring event during the
          Crediting Term:

       1. If the final GHG level was above the last recorded GHG level,
             the existing balance of Permanence Reversal Buffer will be
             issued to Project Proponent.

       2. If the final level was below the last recorded level:

          1. The gap will be withdrawn from the Permanence Reversal
                Buffer and immediately retired. The remainder will be
                distributed to the Project Proponent.

          2. If the Permanence Reversal Buffer balance does not cover
                the gap, the Project Proponent will have the following
                options to compensate for the gap:

    -  Use non-transacted (yet-to-be-sold) credits in Project
          Proponent’s Regen Registry account.

    -  Purchase credits to compensate for the gap in carbon stock. The
          purchased credits can be from Regen Registry, or from
          Established Registries.

10. Premature Project Ending Process

    1. In the event that the project has ended prematurely, the Project
          Proponents are still contractually obligated to maintain the
          permanence requirements for each credit vintage sold.

    2. Regen Registry will follow the same approach at the end of
          permanence period for carbon stock reconciliation - see
          section 8.7.3.

    3. If no monitoring and verification report was conducted at the end
          of the permanence period, in order to be conservative, Regen
          Registry will assume a default loss of 10% in carbon stock
          level from last recorded level. If the Permanence Reversal
          Buffer was insufficient to cover that loss, the Project
          Proponent will be required to purchase credits to compensate
          for that loss.

11. Purchase of credits to compensate for carbon loss

    1. In any event, per above, that the Project Proponent is required
          to purchase credits to compensate for carbon loss, these
          credits shall be from other like projects with similar
          regional characteristics and co-benefits, either from Regen
          Registry or from Established Registries.

**Leakage**
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Leakage is an increase in GHG emissions or decrease in sequestration
   outside the project boundaries that occurs because of the project’s
   actions.

   Each Credit Class shall define the appropriate procedures to address
   leakage.

   Over time, if certain land management activities have consistently
   been found to create substantial leakage across multiple projects,
   Regen Registry will remove those activities from the approved list of
   practices.

**Avoiding Double Counting**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Double counting refers to situations where a single GHG emission
   reduction or removal is used more than once to demonstrate
   achievement of mitigation targets and/or pledges typically made by
   corporations/entities and countries. Double counting can occur either
   as double issuance, double sale, or double claiming.

   Double claiming is of concern in international carbon trading and in
   determining Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris
   Agreement [25]_, when an emission reduction is counted once by the
   country of origin when reporting its emissions inventory, and again
   by the receiving country (or other entity) when justifying emissions
   above its pledged climate effort. In the absence of rules, a country
   of origin could reduce emissions to meet its pledged effort and
   transfer those to a recipient; the recipient could then claim those
   same reductions to meet its pledged effort. In that case, only one
   reduction has actually occurred, but it is being claimed twice.
   Analyses indicate that such double-claiming could eliminate the
   entire climate benefit of all the NDCs. [26]_

   Regen Registry has program rules and operational processes to
   mitigate these double counting risks. To avoid double claiming, all
   credits will be tracked on Regen Ledger, a custom-built ecological
   ledger leveraging blockchain technology (specifically the Cosmos
   SDK [27]_), which provides public immutable records for transactions.
   The data on Regen Ledger is available for external scrutiny and
   validation and provides a digital audit trail for transactions, at
   any given point in time. Examples include who was issued credits and
   their location, who currently owns credits, when each credit was
   retired, and who claimed the GHG benefit and their location.

+---------------+---------------------------+--------------------------+

..

   When any country or state approves the trading of carbon credits
   (along with the carbon claims associated with them), Regen Registry
   will adhere to guidelines as established by the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [28]_ and Carbon
   Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
   (CORSIA) [29]_ to prevent double counting towards NDC and CORSIA
   obligations respectively, and to ensure the environmental integrity
   of emissions reductions.

Verification
------------

   This section provides a general overview of the requirements for ex
   post verification of GHG and Co-Benefits assertions by an independent
   third-party verifier approved by Regen Registry.

   As defined in this section, verification will be conducted by an
   independent verifier chosen by the Project Proponent and approved by
   Regen Registry.

   Regen Registry seeks a balance between adequate assurances, the
   overhead, and costs associated with verification. Therefore, each
   Credit Class can stipulate the requirements that are best suited to
   the ecosystem, best management practice and/or locale(s) it pertains
   to. Regen Registry retains the right to adapt the requirements and
   provide verification templates/interfaces as needed.

.. _definitions-1:

**Definitions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

12. Validation is the systematic, independent, and documented process
       for the evaluation of the reasonableness of the assumptions,
       limitations, and methods that support a statement about future
       (ex-ante) GHG and Co-Benefits outcomes.

13. Verification is the systematic, independent, and documented
       assessment by a qualified ,impartial third-party of the GHG and
       Co-Benefits assertion for a specific reporting period.

14. Regen Registry does not require an ex-ante GHG estimate in the
       Project Plan and therefore validation is not necessary. Instead,
       the verifier validates the project eligibility according to the
       rules defined in the Program Guide, Credit Class and the Approved
       Methodology. Regen Registry has simplified the eligibility
       requirements and considers verification an applicable standard.
       However, each Credit Class can customize the requirements as
       needed and add validation.

**Verifier Requirements**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

15. The Project Proponent can choose a verifier from either of the
       following options:

    1. Verification bodies accredited under ISO 14065 and in good
          standing with their relevant ISO member body.

    2. Verifiers approved by Established Registries.

    3. Verifiers that satisfy these minimum requirements:

       1. Have sufficient proof of identity.

       2. Obtain Errors & Omissions Insurance for at least $1 million.

       3. Has demonstrated technical expertise in agriculture and
             grazing.

       4. Be in a position of fiduciary duty.

    4. Verifiers that are accredited under ISO 14065 (per article
          10.2.1.1) and/or approved by Established Registries are
          automatically approved to be verifiers on Regen Registry.
          Other verifiers must submit an application for consideration.
          A list of approved verifiers will be made available on the
          Regen Registry website.

    5. In order to increase the assurance level in projects, Project
          Proponents shall engage at least two lead verifiers over the
          lifetime of their project, where the final project
          verification is done by a different verifier than the one used
          in prior verification events.

    6. Verifiers must sign a statement confirming their lack of conflict
          of interest with the Project Proponent. Regen Registry and the
          Project Proponent must be satisfied that any potential for
          conflict of interest can be mitigated. To limit the potential
          for conflict of interest, these restrictions are put in place:

       1. Verifiers will not conduct a verification for any project in
             which:

          1. Any member of the verification team has a financial
                interest in the project or the Project Proponent.

          2. The Verifier has played a role in developing the project.

       2. The verifier will disclose all relationships, such as familial
             or fiduciary, within the past three years between the
             Verifier on the one hand, and the project and Project
             Proponent on the other.

**Payment for Verification**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

16. Project Proponent is responsible for engaging and paying for
       verifications.

**Evidence Gathering**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

17. Verifier shall take necessary and appropriate steps to assure the
       project inputs are authentic, using a random sampling approach
       whenever appropriate. Verifiers will adhere to the Regen Registry
       data privacy policy to ensure Project Proponent maintains privacy
       of their data.

18. Verifiers are required to provide assurance as to the reasonableness
       and accuracy of the data the Project Proponent has provided to
       Regen Registry and the Monitor, but they are not asked to attest
       to the validity or accuracy of the outputs of the Monitor.

19. The Approved Methodology contains specific guidance on the scope of
       evidence gathering necessary to provide reasonable assurance with
       respect to the data the Project Proponent provides the Monitor.

20. The verification includes but is not limited to the following
       categories:

    1. Project Plan - the verifier shall verify the information provided
          in the Project Plan.

    2. Project Ownership and Rights

       1. Verifier shall verify that the Project Proponent has legal
             rights to the land defined in the project boundaries. If
             the Project Proponent is an organization, the verifier
             shall also verify the documents provided to Regen Registry
             have been signed by the organization’s representatives
             without a reasonable doubt.

       2. The verifier shall choose the appropriate level of Land Owner
             rights verification from the list below, where the default
             shall be the least strictest approach. Documentation
             verification levels, from strictest to least:

          1. Evidence of land title or deed of ownership - official
                documentation of Federal / State government.

          2. Rate payments, such as utility services provided by local
                jurisdictions to the property and Project Proponent.

          3. Copies of email exchanges, letters, agreements or similar
                documentation (or their extracts).

       3. In the case the land is leased, the verifier shall also verify
             the lease agreement between Project Proponent (or the
             entity/individual represented) and Land Owner.

       4. If the Project Proponent is representing the Land Owner, the
             verifier shall verify the Deed of Representation between
             the Project Proponent and the Land Owner.

    3. Data inputs provided by Project Proponent to the Monitor - as
          stipulated by the Approved Methodology.

    4. The Monitor followed the procedures stipulated in the Approved
          Methodology.

    5. Compliance

       1. Compliance with Credit Class and Approved Methodology
             requirements:

          1. Project eligibility - see section above for full details.
                Including, but not limited to:

             1. Ownership type - matches the type mentioned in Project
                   Plan

             2. Project Activity falls within the defined accepted list
                   of activities

             3. Project Area matches land tenure descriptions

             4. Adoption Date falls after the earliest accepted date and
                   evidence is provided to attest to that

          2. No double issuance - see Avoiding Double Counting section

       2. Compliance with existing laws and regulations

    6. Leakage - verifying estimated leakage by Project Proponent is a
          reasonable estimate (for example, uses regional default
          emission factors or is in line with similar projects).

**Verification Report** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

21. Verifiers shall generate a report summarizing their findings,
       including a verification rating from one of the following
       options:

    1. Acceptance - if all the corresponding requirements in the
          Evidence Gathering section (10.4) have been satisfactorily
          met.

    2. Acceptance with Contingencies -

       1. If there were any deviations from the Approved Methodology.

       2. If data provided by the Project Proponent (e.g. in the Project
             Plan) which is inconsequential to GHG estimation, could not
             be satisfactorily verified.

    3. Rejection -

       1. If project ownership could not be satisfactorily verified.

       2. If the Monitor did not follow key Methodology guidelines
             (excluding minor deviations).

       3. If data provided by the Project Proponent for GHG estimation
             is suspected to be fraudulent.

       4. Lack of compliance with Project Eligibility, Double Counting
             requirements, or existing laws/regulations.

22. In terms of data to sample, verifiers shall follow the guidance
       provided in Table 1.0 per verification type.

**Verification Acceptance**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

23. Regen Registry will review each verification report and proceed
       based on its rating:

    1. Acceptance - Regen Registry will issue credits (if applicable) to
          the Project Proponents per the monitoring outcome and Program
          Guide / Credit Class stipulations.

    2. Acceptance with Contingencies -

       1. the Project Proponent shall make the necessary corrections and
             clarifications per the contingencies identified in the
             report. If needed, the Verifier will resubmit their report
             after reviewing the information provided by the Project
             Proponent.

       2. Regen Registry will issue credits (if applicable) following
             the Acceptance procedure above.

       3. If the resubmitted verification report still retains the
             Acceptance with Contingencies, Regen Registry will
             highlight this in the corresponding MRV section.

    3. Rejection -

       1. The project is put on hold until the issues identified are
             addressed (see Project on Hold section).

       2. The carbon stock level will revert to the last level that was
             recorded and verified with the verification report with
             Acceptance or Acceptance with Contingencies rating. If the
             project has already been issued credits, then the Buffer
             Pool will be used to reconcile any gaps (see Buffer Pool
             section).

24. Regen Registry will post all verification reports to Regen Registry.

**Verification Schedule**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

25. The verification schedule will be optimized to limit the amount of
       verifications needed and maximize the assurance level in credit
       issuance:

    1. Project Registration - to be completed within six months after
          Project Registration Date.

    2. Credit Issuance

       1. Threshold verification - any issuance of GHG removal credit
             representing more than 25K tons of CO2e/yr shall require a
             verification report prior to issuance.

       2. On-going verification - these are intended to provide
             assurances over the maximum number of credits issued during
             the Crediting Term while at the same time limiting the
             overall audit expenses. To that end, Project Proponents
             shall select at which issuance event to perform this type
             of verification such that each one covers at least two
             monitoring periods. The verification shall be completed
             within three months of the last monitoring round chosen.
             Note, there is no need for an additional round of
             verification if a threshold based verification has
             occurred.

    3. Final Project Verification - to be completed at the end of the
          project; must be a different verifier than the one used in
          prior verifications.

**Unscheduled Verification**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

26. The following circumstances will warrant a potential additional
       verification:

    1. A previous verification report with a Rejection or Acceptance
          with Contingencies ranking.

    2. Significant variance (>25%) from benchmark carbon sequestration
          rates for Project Activity.

    3. Compliance verifications - when Regen Registry has reasonable
          grounds to suspect the Project Proponent has contravened, is
          contravening, or is proposing to contravene with the rules and
          regulations.

**Verification Oversight**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

27. Regen Registry reserves the right to conduct oversight activities of
       verification performance participating verifiers. Oversight
       activities are conducted to ensure an adequate level of quality
       control and are intended to supplement accreditation body
       oversight and audit processes.

Monitoring
----------

   Regen Registry requires monitoring to be conducted by an independent
   Monitor chosen by the Project Proponent and approved by Regen
   Registry.

   The Monitor shall follow the requirements in the Approved Methodology
   to quantify the benefits and indicators defined in the respective
   Credit Class.

.. _definitions-2:

**Definitions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

28. Monitoring :mark:`means measurement of an ecological indicator(s),
       following the guidelines of a given methodology. Measurements can
       use various approaches, for instance remote sensing using
       satellite imagery or estimation using biogeochemical methods.`

29. Baseline - a measurement of a certain ecological indicator tracked
       in a given credit had the project not been implemented. A
       baseline can be static, dynamic, project specific or based on
       performance standard (or a combination of those) [30]_.

30. Monitoring round - a scheduled time following the methodology
       guidelines in which a Monitor performs the measurement or
       estimation of an ecological indicator(s).

**Monitor Requirements**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

31. The Project Proponent can choose a Monitor from either of the
       following options:

    1. Regen Network monitoring services.

    2. Monitors that satisfy these minimum requirements:

       1. Have sufficient proof of identity.

       2. Obtain Errors & Omissions Insurance for at least $1 million.

       3. Has demonstrated technical expertise in the methods specified
             in the Approved Methodology, for example: satellite imagery
             and GIS analysis, biogeochemical models (if applicable),
             statistical analysis, GHG estimation, etc.

    3. Monitors must submit an application for consideration. A list of
          approved Monitors will be made available on the Regen Registry
          website.

    4. Monitors must sign a statement confirming their lack of conflict
          of interest with the Project Proponent. Regen Registry and the
          Project Proponent must be satisfied that any potential for
          conflict of interest can be mitigated. To limit the potential
          for conflict of interest, these restrictions are put in place:

       1. Monitors will not provide monitoring for any project in which:

          1. Any member of the monitoring team has a financial interest
                in the project or the Project Proponent.

          2. The Monitor has played a role in implementing the Project
                Activity on the ground.

       2. The Monitor will disclose all relationships, such as familial
             or fiduciary, within the past three years between the
             Monitor on the one hand, and the project and Project
             Proponent on the other.

       3. These requirements equally apply to Regen Network monitoring
             services.

    5. Regen Network Development acts as the first approved Monitor on
          Regen Registry.

**Payment for Monitoring**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

32. Project Proponent is responsible for engaging and paying for
       monitoring.

**Monitoring Procedure**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

33. The Monitor shall gather all the monitoring data (if applicable)
       provided by the Project Proponent using the respective Regen
       Registry templates. If there is missing information, the Monitor
       will communicate the gaps to the Project Proponent who in turn
       will resubmit the monitoring data.

34. The Monitor shall gather all other sources of data specified in the
       Approved Methodology necessary for the quantification process,
       for example satellite imagery or metrics from scientific
       literature.

35. The Monitor shall use the appropriate tools and follow the
       procedures in the Approved Methodology to quantify each
       ecological indicator.

36. The Monitor shall submit a monitoring report summarizing the
       quantification results and including the number of credits the
       Project Proponent is eligible for based on the definitions in the
       Approved Methodology and the Credit Class. The Monitor shall
       apply any estimation uncertainty deductions (if applicable per
       the Approved Methodology) to the number of credits reported.

**Monitoring Procedure Deviations** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

37. Regen Registry will permit project-specific deviations from the
       Approved Methodology where they do not negatively affect the
       conservativeness of an Approved Methodology’s approach to the
       quantification of GHG emissions reductions and removal
       enhancements.

38. Monitors shall submit any proposed project-specific deviation to
       Regen Registry using the Deviation from Methodology
       Template [31]_. Monitors must provide evidence that the proposed
       deviation, such as a substitute calculation method for missing
       data, meets the conservative standards of the methodology.

39. Regen Registry will review each such request, and if approved,
       deviations can be applied to a specific project, but are not
       published as modifications to the methodology.

**Monitoring Acceptance**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

40. Regen Registry will review each monitoring report to verify it
       conforms to the templates and the procedures specified in the
       Approved Methodology. If corrections are needed, the Monitor
       shall resubmit the monitoring report with the corrections.

41. Credit Issuance - If the monitoring report indicates the Project
       Proponent is eligible for credits and no verification is needed
       (see the Verification section requirements), Regen Registry will
       issue credits to Project Proponent after the appropriate
       deductions as specified in the Program Guide and Credit Class.

42. Regen Registry will make all monitoring reports publicly available.

**Monitoring Schedule**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

43. The monitoring schedule will be dictated by the requirements in the
       Approved Methodology and will include:

    1. Baseline measurement - performed upon project registration.

    2. On-going measurements - as needed per the Approved Methodology.

    3. Final Project Monitoring - to be completed at the end of the
          Crediting Term.

    4. End of Permanence Monitoring - if applicable, a final monitoring
          round will be completed at the end of the permanence period.

**Monitoring Oversight**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

44. Regen Registry reserves the right to conduct oversight activities of
       monitoring performance of participating verifiers. Oversight
       activities are conducted to ensure an adequate level of quality
       control and are intended to supplement accreditation body
       oversight and audit processes.

Credit Classes
--------------

   Regen Registry aims to democratize and invigorate the design of
   ecosystem service credits. To that end we are separating out the
   typical set of definitions that are part and parcel of most registry
   standards and allow Credit Designers to modify and upgrade these as
   needed and appropriate. These include:

-  Credit definition

-  Project eligibility requirements

-  GHG accounting related requirements including permanence, leakage and
      additionality.

-  Verification requirements

-  Reporting and compliance requirements

..

   The Registry Program Guide and the Credit Class templates provide the
   guidelines for creating new credits, thus enabling innovation while
   maintaining a high standard of rigor.

   While a subset of Credit Classes might be developed by RND, the
   intention is to build a vibrant community of Credit Designers that
   will take the lead going forward.

   Regen Registry aims to create a broad set of Credit Classes that
   cover different ecosystems, geographical regions and localities, and
   are tailored for different stakeholders (e.g. smallholder farmers,
   corporate farms, indigineous communities, conservation organizations,
   etc).

   One of our key assumptions is that creating a one-size-fits-all
   solution is suboptimal and does not tap into collective potential.
   Ecological systems are inherently complex. Regenerative farming,
   grazing ,and conservation are complex, nuanced, and locale specific.
   Similarly, the needs and risk profile of credit buyers vary
   substantially depending on the size of the company, its sector,
   climate goals, etc. As such, we believe a successful solution needs
   to leverage commonalities and best practices, while simultaneously
   allowing for flexibility in design.

**New Credit Classes**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following process is applied to all new Credit Classes, whether
   developed internally by RND or by external Credit Designers.

   In such cases, Regen Registry coordinates a process of:

   1) Internal review

   2) Beta (optional)

   3) Technical review committee

   4) Public stakeholder consultation (optional)

   Regen Registry administers the following process, at fees per the
   current schedule.

1. Concept note - the Credit Designer submits to Regen Registry a review
      for a Credit Class concept note, included but not limited to the
      following:

   1. Market analysis demonstrating potential for GHG removal or
         improvement in other relevant ecological indicators by the
         proposed activity.

   2. An analysis of the ability and timing to scale impact given
         geographic, regulatory or other pertinent considerations.

   3. Sample project using (or planning to use) the proposed Credit
         Class including an economic analysis demonstrating that the
         proposed activity is viable under current market conditions.

..

   Regen Registry will review the concept note and determine whether to
   move forward with it.

2. Credit Class draft - the Credit Designer submits the proposed new or
      modified Credit Class to Regen Registry based on the appropriate
      template. Regen Registry reviews the draft, asks for
      clarifications, and points out corrections that are needed.

3. Beta (optional) - once the necessary clarifications and corrections
      are made, the Credit Designer can choose to move it to beta
      status. At this point, a Project Proponent can apply for a project
      using the beta Credit Class. Regen Registry encourages Credit
      Designers to collect feedback from Project Proponents as they go
      through the beta process, in order to ensure viability of the
      Credit Class. Feedback from the Project Proponent on the proposed
      Credit Class will be documented by Regen Registry and incorporated
      into the subsequent stages in the approval process.

4. Technical review committee - the revised Credit Class is provided to
      a technical review committee that Regen Registry assembles
      consisting of independent and impartial subject matter experts.
      Regen Registry actively identifies and qualifies candidate
      committee members, and publicly solicits applications from
      interested parties. Once the review is complete, the committee
      lead compiles the comments and recommendations from the committee,
      and prepares a summary report. Regen Registry delivers to the
      Credit Designers the summary report, to which they must respond by
      incorporating revisions and/or documenting justifications for the
      proposed approach. Timing and cost of the technical review
      committee depends on the complexity, scope, and quality of the
      Credit Class and the availability of technical reviewers.

5. Public consultation process (optional) - Regen Registry coordinates a
      public consultation process. The Credit Class is posted publicly
      on the Regen Registry website for a minimum of 30 days inviting
      public comments. During this period, the Credit Designer may also
      choose to conduct a webinar to present the draft Credit Class and
      solicit additional comments. At the conclusion of the public
      comment period, the comments are compiled into a report and sent
      to the Credit Designer, who then has 30 days to respond to
      comments in writing and incorporate relevant feedback to a revised
      version, which is then posted on the Regen Registry website.

6. Credit Class approval - once all required corrections have been made,
      Regen Registry approves the new Credit Class and publishes it on
      its website.

7. Process documentation - Regen Registry documents the entire Credit
      Class approval process including beta feedback, public comments
      and responses, technical committee comments and responses, and the
      corresponding versions of the Credit Class at each stage.

**Modifications to Approved Credit Classes**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Regen Registry may permit modifications to an existing approved
   Credit Class where they maintain the guidelines stipulated in the
   Regen Registry Program Guide. Credit Class modifications may be
   submitted for review by Regen Registry, at fees per the current fee
   schedule. Regen Registry will review the extent of the modification
   and determine what steps in the approval process above need to be
   implemented.

.. _governance-1:

**Governance**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Regen Registry will initially govern the process of adding new Credit
   Classes per above process. In the future our aim is to move towards
   an independent, decentralized governance of these methodologies by a
   broad set of stakeholders, including subject matter experts, land
   stewards, project developers, monitors, and verifiers.

Methodologies
-------------

   Regen Registry aims to establish a robust set of scientifically
   rigorous methodologies, leveraging cutting edge technologies, and the
   latest science. While a subset of these methodologies might be
   developed by RND, the intention is to build a vibrant community of
   Methodology Developers that will take the lead going forward.

**New Methodologies** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following process is applied to all new methodologies, whether
   developed internally by RND or by external Methodology Developers.

   In such cases, Regen Registry coordinates a process of:

   1) Concept note and draft

   2) Beta (optional)

   2) Public stakeholder consultation

   3) Scientific peer review process.

   Regen Registry administers this process, at fees per the current
   schedule.

8. Concept note - the Methodology Developer submits to Regen Registry
      for review a methodology concept note, including but not limited
      to the following:

   1. Market analysis demonstrating potential for GHG removal or
         improvement in other relevant ecological indicators by the
         proposed activity.

   2. Sample project using (or planning to use) the proposed methodology
         including an economic analysis demonstrating that the proposed
         activity is viable under current market conditions.

..

   Regen Registry will review the concept note and determine whether to
   move forward with it.

9.  Methodology draft - the Methodology Developer submits the proposed
       new or modified methodology to Regen Registry following the
       appropriate template. Regen Registry screens the methodology,
       asks for clarifications and points out corrections that are
       needed.

10. Beta (optional) - once the necessary clarifications and corrections
       are made, the Methodology Developer can choose to move it to beta
       status. At this point, a Project Proponent can apply for a
       project using the beta methodology. Regen Registry encourages
       Methodology Developers to collect feedback from Project
       Proponents as they go through the beta in order to ensure
       viability of the methodology. Feedback from the Project Proponent
       on the proposed methodology will be documented by Regen Registry
       and incorporated into the public consultation process.

11. Public consultation process - Regen Registry coordinates a public
       consultation process. The methodology is posted publicly on the
       Regen Registry website for a minimum of 30 days inviting public
       comments. During this period, the Methodology Developer may also
       choose to conduct a webinar to present the draft methodology and
       solicit additional comments. At the conclusion of the public
       comment period, the comments are compiled into a report and sent
       to the Methodology Developer, who then has 30 days to respond to
       comments in writing and incorporate relevant feedback to a
       revised version, which is then posted on the Regen Registry
       website.

12. Scientific peer review process - the revised methodology is provided
       to a team of independent subject matter experts for a scientific
       peer review process. Regen Registry may consult a technical
       committee in the selection of impartial reviewers with the
       applicable subject matter expertise. Regen Registry actively
       identifies and qualifies candidate reviewers, and publicly
       solicits applications from interested parties. Once the review is
       complete, the lead reviewer compiles comments and recommendations
       from the peer review team, and prepares a summary report. Regen
       Registry delivers to the Methodology Developer the peer reviewed
       report, to which she must respond by incorporating revisions
       and/or documenting justifications for the proposed approach.
       Generally, several rounds of peer review are necessary. Timing
       and cost of peer review depends on the complexity, scope, and
       quality of the methodology and the availability of peer
       reviewers.

13. Methodology approval - once all required corrections have been made,
       Regen Registry approves the new methodology and publishes it on
       its website.

14. Process documentation - Regen Registry documents the entire
       methodology approval process including beta feedback, public
       comments and responses, peer review comments and responses, and
       the corresponding versions of the methodology at each stage.

**Modifications to Approved Methodologies**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Regen Registry may permit modifications to an existing approved
   methodology where they do not negatively affect the conservativeness
   of the methodology’s approach to determining additionality and
   quantification of GHG removals and co-benefits. Methodology
   modifications may be submitted for review by Regen Registry, at fees
   per the current fee schedule. Regen Registry will review the extent
   of the modification and determine whether the internal review, public
   consultation, and peer review process must be implemented.
   Modifications to eligibility, applicability, Project Activities,
   and/or baseline assumptions are likely to trigger the full process
   while minor modifications to correct quantification errors or provide
   clarification on monitoring requirements will not require the full
   process.

**Regen Registry and Established Registries published methodologies**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Current versions of methodologies for nature-based / AFOLU projects
   that are approved by the Established Registries are generally
   approved for use; however, Project Proponents implementing projects
   under these methodologies must first go through the Regen Registry
   approval process as described below.

.. _governance-2:

**Governance**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Regen Registry will initially govern the process of adding new
   methodologies per above process. Our aim is in the future to move
   towards an independent, decentralized governance of these
   methodologies by a broad set of stakeholders including subject matter
   experts, land stewards, project developers, monitors, and verifiers.

Co-Benefits 
------------

1. Introduction

..

   Co-benefits of climate change mitigation, as defined in the 4th
   Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC), are the positive benefits related to the reduction of GHG.
   Examples of such climate mitigation policies include improved energy
   efficiency of plants, renewable energy uptake and fuel switching,
   which might enable a range of co-benefits, such as air-pollution
   impacts, technological innovation, energy-supply security through
   increased energy diversity, reduced fuel cost, and employment
   possibilities.

   In the context of AFOLU projects, a variety of co-benefits are
   possible including environmental, social, economic, indigineous
   rights, and many more.

   Interlinked with co-benefits is the shared blueprint the UN adopted
   in 2015 for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. At its
   heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [32]_, which
   are an urgent call for action by all countries in a global
   partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other
   deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health
   and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all
   while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and
   forests.

2. Credit Class requirements

..

   Regen Registry is encouraging Credit Developers to include
   co-benefits in all Credit Classes. This applies to both GHG removal
   credits and other types of credits (e.g. biodiversity). In that sense
   we hold the “co-benefit” term loosely in the sense that all benefits
   are important, whether they are tied directly to climate change
   mitigation and GHG removal or not.

   Therefore, each Credit Class shall identify the applicable
   co-benefits and how to measure and verify them. To that end, Regen
   Registry will introduce in the future a framework and/or taxonomy to
   help Credit Developers identify co-benefits and SDGs related to
   certain types of projects, and stipulate how to measure and verify
   them. These co-benefits and SDGs will be shown on Regen Registry to
   highlight the broader impact of each project.

Purchasing and selling credits
------------------------------

3. Account creation

..

   Project Proponents (or sellers) and Buyers will create an account on
   Regen Registry to which credits will be issued or transferred
   respectively. The registration process might require an appropriate
   KYC (Know Your Customer) verification depending on the nature of the
   asset issued and corresponding regulations.

4. Selling credits -

..

   Credit holders - whether Project Proponents whom have been issued
   credits or Buyers who had purchased tradable credits - have a few
   options to sell their credits:

-  Direct / offline sale - a seller can negotiate directly with a
      prospective buyer and offer them the credits.

-  Regen Registry brokerage services - a seller can choose to use Regen
      Registry’s brokerage services that will outreach to prospective
      buyers and sell the credits at the price agreed upon with the
      Project Proponent.

-  Marketplace - a seller can offer the credits for sale on Regen
      Registry online marketplace and select their price. The project
      credits can be sold separately or as part of a portfolio of
      projects.

-  Resell - this is a variant of the direct sale approach in which a
      seller sells their credits to a third party, or a reseller, that
      in turn will identify and sell the credits to a buyer(s).

-  Exchange - in the future, a seller will be able to offer their
      credits on an exchange facilitated by Regen Ledger [33]_

-  3rd party integrations - in the future, Regen Registry will establish
      integrations with 3rd parties that offer GHG credits (offsets) for
      instance to their respective client base.

-  Auctions - in the future, Regen Registry may run a period auction as
      is custom in some registries.

..

   Note, these options will be updated on a regular basis and might
   change from time to time. Further, as noted, not all of these options
   are currently available.

1. Fee structure.

..

   The fee structure for the issuance and sale of credits depend on the
   Credit Class, Methodology requirements and sales approach used. Regen
   Registry will make the fee structure transparent on the website.

Complaints and appeals
----------------------

2. Complaints procedure

..

   When a Project Proponent or other stakeholder objects to a decision
   made by Regen Registry representatives or the application of the
   Regen Registry program requirements, the following confidential
   complaint procedure shall be followed:

-  Project Proponent or other stakeholder sends a written complaint via
      email to
      `support-registry@regen.network <http://support-registry@regen.network>`__
      . The complaint must detail the following:

   -  Description of the complaint with specific reference to the
         Program Guide, Credit Class or Methodology requirements as
         applicable.

   -  Supporting documentation provided for consideration in the
         complaint resolution process.

   -  Complainant name, contact details, and organization.

..

   Regen Registry staff shall investigate the complaint. The staff
   member assigned to handle the complaint shall not have been involved
   with the issue that is the subject of the formal complaint. Regen
   Registry will provide a written response, via email, to the
   complainant detailing the decision on the matter.

1. Appeals procedure

..

   In the event that a complaint remains unresolved after the conclusion
   of the complaints procedure, the Project Proponent or stakeholder may
   appeal any such decision or outcome reached. The following
   confidential appeals procedure shall be followed:

-  Project Proponent or other stakeholder sends a written appeal via
      email to
      `support-registry@regen.network <http://support-registry@regen.network>`__.
      The appeal must detail the following:

   -  Description of the complaint with specific reference to the
         Program Guide, Credit Class or Methodology requirements as
         applicable;

   -  Supporting documentation provided for consideration in the appeal
         process, including previous communication on the complaint and
         all relevant details of the previously implemented complaint
         procedure

   -  Appellant name, contact details, and organization.

-  Regen Registry shall convene a committee to review and discuss the
      matter. The committee will include a member of the RND board of
      directors, a member of RND executive team, and an Regen Registry
      staff member unrelated to the complaint, all of whom will have
      equal votes. The committee may also include a technical and/or
      subject matter expert or experts as necessary, who will not be
      able to vote. The committee members selected will depend on the
      subject matter and nature of the appeal.

-  The decision reached by the committee shall be communicated, via
      written response, to the Project Proponent or stakeholder. Any
      decision reached by the committee shall be final.

Linkages to other registries
----------------------------

   Regen Registry welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with other
   reputable GHG (and other ecosystem service) programs, both voluntary
   and regulated. The collaboration can manifest in different ways,
   including but not limited to:

-  Digital MRV - providing low cost monitoring to project developers.

-  Marketplace and exchange - providing liquidity to sellers and buyers
      along with built-in payments and billing infrastructure.

-  Marketing - showcasing the unique story of each project, highlighting
      the land stewards behind it and the impact on the land and our
      environment; providing buyers and policy makers with impact
      analytics on a portfolio, regional, national and global level on
      key ecological indicators.

-  Regen Ledger - providing a transparent and digital auditable tracking
      of credit issuance and transfer, and monitoring and verification
      reports.

..

   All of these integration points do not require any change to existing
   infrastructure or procedures within these GHG programs. To learn more
   please email
   `admin-registry@regen.network <http://admin-registry@regen.network>`__
   .

   In the event, a Project Proponent wishes to transfer a project from
   another GHG (or other ecosystem service) program, the project must
   adhere to all the requirements in the Program Guide, and respective
   Credit Class and Methodology. To avoid double issuance of GHG credits
   (whether removals or emission reduction) see also the requirements in
   the ‘Avoiding double counting’ section.
