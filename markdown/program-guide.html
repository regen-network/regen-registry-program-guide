<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Every day, business is done while neglecting some of our most
important partners: Farmers and the Earth. The result are destructive
global consequences like climate change, desertification, and resource
depletion that affect nearly every aspect of human life. The United
Nations FAO estimates <mark>33% of the Earth's soils are already
degraded and over 90% could become degraded by 2050</mark><a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a><mark>.</mark></p>
<p>The price tag to ‘fix’ these problems is estimated to be in the
trillions, paralyzing global efforts to quickly address climate change.
There may be nothing of more critical importance today than the
regeneration of the world’s ecosystems.</p>
<p>Farmers, the stewards of our global landscapes, offer one of the most
powerful pathways for reversing climate change and unlocking a massive
untapped market in the world: the services and products generated by
Earth’s ecosystems. Regen Registry coupled with Regen Ledger, an
ecological blockchain-based ledger, create a new platform for farmers to
monetize their ecological data while receiving rewards for sustainable
practices. By improving the understanding of the state of our land,
oceans, and watersheds and enabling rewards for verified positive
changes, Regen Network catalyzes the regeneration of our ecosystems.</p>
<p>Regen Network was launched in Q2, 2018 and is headquartered in Great
Barrington, Massachusetts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Program Guide details the general requirements and specifications
for the quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV),
project registration, and issuance of credits on Regen Registry. The
common characteristic of all Regen Registry credits is that they are all
nature-based solutions, and each can provide one or more ecosystem
services, including GHG emissions reductions and removals,
biodiversity/habitat protection, improvement in water quality, and
more<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Program Guide establishes the programmatic structure of Regen
Registry, including credit classes and methodologies, the project
registration process, project eligibility, and the issuance of tradable
environmental assets to projects. This guide is intended to be used by
Project Proponents, buyers, Monitors, Verifiers, and all other
stakeholders.</p>
<p>Regen Registry aims to maximize flexibility and usability for Project
Proponents while maintaining the environmental integrity and scientific
rigor necessary to ensure that projects developed against its credit
classes and methodologies are of the highest quality.</p>
<p>Project Proponents developing a project for registration on Regen
Registry shall follow this Program Guide and must apply a Regen Registry
approved credit class and methodology.</p>
<p>Project Proponents and other interested stakeholders should refer to
the Regen Registry website for the latest version of the Program Guide,
methodologies, document templates, and other guidance. Regen Registry
will inform Project Proponents with active projects directly to avoid
any potential disruptions.</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<li><blockquote>
<p>Description</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Regen Registry is an open source ecosystem services registry in which
Project Proponents can register projects, apply for credits, and
transfer and sell credits to buyers. Buyers can resell or retire credits
(in the case of carbon credits). Each credit vintage issued has a unique
ID, is project-based, is geospatially tagged and independently
verified<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Regen Registry aims to provide an open source, vertically integrated
solution that provides:</p>
<p>a) Digital MRV - software infrastructure that provides monitoring
tools - through in-house remote sensing and interoperability with 3rd
party tools - that streamline the cost and issuance of credits.</p>
<p>b) Marketing platform - showcases the unique story of each project,
highlighting the land stewards, the impact on the land and environment;
provides buyers and policy makers with impact analytics on a portfolio
(regional, national, and global) of key ecological indicators.</p>
<p>c) Marketplace and exchange (trading platform) - sellers offer their
credits for sale; buyers purchase from one or multiple projects and
build a portfolio; the system provides a clearing <mark>and settlement
infrastructure including</mark> payments and billing.</p>
<p>d) Regen Ledger - a custom-built ecological ledger using blockchain
technology where credits are issued and transferred, and monitoring and
verification claims are recorded as immutable records.</p>
<p>Each layer offered within the Regen Registry is standalone and
Project Proponents can choose which ones to use. For example, a Project
Proponent can choose to perform the monitoring in-house, based on the
methodology guidelines, rather than use a Monitor that leverages our
software stack. That said, integrated use of all layers will enable
significant advantages in ease-of-use, effectiveness, and cost
efficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Relative to their potential, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU) carbon credits have seen limited adoption in regulatory and
voluntary markets. Historically, the supply of these credits has been
limited because credit design has not incorporated enough feedback from
land stewards, resulting in credit requirements that were complicated,
expensive and/or time consuming. Regen Registry follows a user centric
design of credit classes and methodologies with input not only from
buyers but also land stewards and project developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="governance">Governance </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Regen Registry is built on the principles of openness, collaboration,
accountability, user centric design, transparency, responsiveness, and
participation. This is applied to Credit Class and Methodology design,
provision of monitoring and verification services, integration with
other registries, and with 3rd-party service providers.</p>
<p>Regen Registry relies on a software implementation that includes two
layers: a) Regen Registry platform - a centralized software layer that
provides user accounts, project pages, administrative functions and b)
Regen Ledger<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> - a decentralized software layer
that is used to issue, transfer, and retire credits and tracks all
pertinent monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) information as
immutable records.</p>
<p>Regen Registry is operated by Regen Network Development, Inc (RND), a
private for-profit company. Regen Ledger is a public decentralized
ledger that is not owned by a single entity (including RND) and is a
Digital Commons<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> that is operated by a network of
independent stakeholders called Validators that are incentivized to
maintain the integrity of the underlying ecological data and credits
tracked on the ledger. Regen Network believes this is the best way to
maintain long term data integrity, auditability, transparency, and
viability, and enables a just allocation of resources and sustained
regeneration of ecological ecosystems (see blog post<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
for more details).</p>
<p>Regen Registry is committed to fully comply with all relevant U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) standards and regulations.</p>
<p>In the event that RND dissolves, the Regen Registry’s contractual
agreements bind both project developers and buyers to uphold any
outstanding contractual commitments as if the two slides are direct
parties to the contracts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept of additionality is often raised as a vital consideration
for quantifying project-based GHG reductions. Additionality is a
criteria that requires GHG reductions to only be recognized for project
activities that would not have “happened anyway.”</p>
<p>While there is general agreement that additionality is important, its
meaning and application remain difficult to define, frequently framed
with imprecise language, and in many cases subject to interpretation.<a

<h3 id="permanence"><strong>Permanence</strong> </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In GHG accounting, permanence refers to the risk that a carbon
reservoir may be subject to gradual long-term or sudden disruptive
release that will reverse the benefit that occurred as a result of
project implementation. GHG emissions reductions from terrestrial
sources and sinks may not be permanent if a project has exposure to risk
factors such as intentional or unintentional events that result in
emissions into the atmosphere of sequestered CO2e for which offset
credits were issued. Terrestrial projects have the potential for GHG
removals to be reversed upon exposure to risk factors, including both
unintentional reversals (e.g. fire, flood, and insect infestation) and
intentional reversals (e.g., landowners choosing to discontinue land
management and/or participate in an activity that reverses the
sequestration).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Land use-based and forestry projects may require the Project
Proponent to register covenants on their land and/or restrict land use
for 40 to 100 years post credit issuance<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>.
This approach is not financially viable for most Project Proponents as
the covenant often results in a reduction in the market value of the
land that is greater than the potential additional revenues from credit
sales.</p>
<p>Further, there is no length of time, short of perpetual, that is
equated with the assurance of permanence, nor is there a sound
scientific basis or accepted international standard around any number of
years that equates to an emission reduction/removal being permanent.</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-double-counting"><strong>Avoiding Double
Counting</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Double counting refers to situations where a single GHG emission
reduction or removal is used more than once to demonstrate achievement
of mitigation targets and/or pledges typically made by
corporations/entities and countries. Double counting can occur either as
double issuance, double sale, or double claiming.</p>
<p>Double claiming is of concern in international carbon trading and in
determining Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris
Agreement<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>, when an emission reduction is
counted once by the country of origin when reporting its emissions
inventory, and again by the receiving country (or other entity) when
justifying emissions above its pledged climate effort. In the absence of
rules, a country of origin could reduce emissions to meet its pledged
effort and transfer those to a recipient; the recipient could then claim
those same reductions to meet its pledged effort. In that case, only one
reduction has actually occurred, but it is being claimed twice. Analyses
indicate that such double-claiming could eliminate the entire climate
benefit of all the NDCs.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Regen Registry has program rules and operational processes to
mitigate these double counting risks. To avoid double claiming, all
credits will be tracked on Regen Ledger, a custom-built ecological
ledger leveraging blockchain technology (specifically the Cosmos SDK<a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>), which provides public immutable
records for transactions. The data on Regen Ledger is available for
external scrutiny and validation and provides a digital audit trail for
transactions, at any given point in time. Examples include who was
issued credits and their location, who currently owns credits, when each
credit was retired, and who claimed the GHG benefit and their
location.</p>

<p>Regen Registry aims to create a broad set of Credit Classes that
cover different ecosystems, geographical regions and localities, and are
tailored for different stakeholders (e.g. smallholder farmers, corporate
farms, indigineous communities, conservation organizations, etc).</p>
<p>One of our key assumptions is that creating a one-size-fits-all
solution is suboptimal and does not tap into collective potential.
Ecological systems are inherently complex. Regenerative farming, grazing
,and conservation are complex, nuanced, and locale specific. Similarly,
the needs and risk profile of credit buyers vary substantially depending
on the size of the company, its sector, climate goals, etc. As such, we
believe a successful solution needs to leverage commonalities and best
practices, while simultaneously allowing for flexibility in design.</p>

During this period, the Methodology Developer may also choose to conduct
a webinar to present the draft methodology and solicit additional
comments. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the comments
are compiled into a report and sent to the Methodology Developer, who
then has 30 days to respond to comments in writing and incorporate
relevant feedback to a revised version, which is then posted on the
Regen Registry website.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Scientific peer review process - the revised methodology is provided
to a team of independent subject matter experts for a scientific peer
review process. Regen Registry may consult a technical committee in the
selection of impartial reviewers with the applicable subject matter
expertise. Regen Registry actively identifies and qualifies candidate
reviewers, and publicly solicits applications from interested parties.
Once the review is complete, the lead reviewer compiles comments and
recommendations from the peer review team, and prepares a summary
report. Regen Registry delivers to the Methodology Developer the peer
reviewed report, to which she must respond by incorporating revisions
and/or documenting justifications for the proposed approach. Generally,
several rounds of peer review are necessary. Timing and cost of peer
review depends on the complexity, scope, and quality of the methodology
and the availability of peer reviewers.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Methodology approval - once all required corrections have been made,
Regen Registry approves the new methodology and publishes it on its
website.</p>

methodology approval process including beta feedback, public comments
and responses, peer review comments and responses, and the corresponding

<h3 id="modifications-to-approved-methodologies"><strong>Modifications
to Approved Methodologies</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Regen Registry may permit modifications to an existing approved
methodology where they do not negatively affect the conservativeness of
the methodology’s approach to determining additionality and
quantification of GHG removals and co-benefits. Methodology
modifications may be submitted for review by Regen Registry, at fees per
the current fee schedule. Regen Registry will review the extent of the
modification and determine whether the internal review, public
consultation, and peer review process must be implemented. Modifications
to eligibility, applicability, Project Activities, and/or baseline
assumptions are likely to trigger the full process while minor
modifications to correct quantification errors or provide clarification
on monitoring requirements will not require the full process.</p>

<p>Current versions of methodologies for nature-based / AFOLU projects

<h3 id="governance-2"><strong>Governance</strong></h3>

<h2 id="co-benefits">Co-Benefits </h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Introduction</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Co-benefits of climate change mitigation, as defined in the 4th
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), are the positive benefits related to the reduction of GHG.
Examples of such climate mitigation policies include improved energy
efficiency of plants, renewable energy uptake and fuel switching, which
might enable a range of co-benefits, such as air-pollution impacts,
technological innovation, energy-supply security through increased
energy diversity, reduced fuel cost, and employment possibilities.</p>
<p>In the context of AFOLU projects, a variety of co-benefits are
possible including environmental, social, economic, indigineous rights,
and many more.</p>
<p>Interlinked with co-benefits is the shared blueprint the UN adopted
in 2015 for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. At its heart
are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>,
which are an urgent call for action by all countries in a global
partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations
must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education,
reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate
change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Credit Class requirements</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Regen Registry is encouraging Credit Developers to include
co-benefits in all Credit Classes. This applies to both GHG removal
credits and other types of credits (e.g. biodiversity). In that sense we
hold the “co-benefit” term loosely in the sense that all benefits are
important, whether they are tied directly to climate change mitigation
and GHG removal or not.</p>
<p>Therefore, each Credit Class shall identify the applicable
co-benefits and how to measure and verify them. To that end, Regen
Registry will introduce in the future a framework and/or taxonomy to
help Credit Developers identify co-benefits and SDGs related to certain
types of projects, and stipulate how to measure and verify them. These
co-benefits and SDGs will be shown on Regen Registry to highlight the
broader impact of each project.</p>
