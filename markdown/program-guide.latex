\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\begin{quote}
Every day, business is done while neglecting some of our most important
partners: Farmers and the Earth. The result are destructive global
consequences like climate change, desertification, and resource
depletion that affect nearly every aspect of human life. The United
Nations FAO estimates \hl{33\% of the Earth\textquotesingle s soils are
already degraded and over 90\% could become degraded by
2050}\footnote{\hl{FAO and ITPS, 2015; IPBES, 2018}}\hl{.}

The price tag to `fix' these problems is estimated to be in the
trillions, paralyzing global efforts to quickly address climate change.
There may be nothing of more critical importance today than the
regeneration of the world's ecosystems.

Farmers, the stewards of our global landscapes, offer one of the most
powerful pathways for reversing climate change and unlocking a massive
untapped market in the world: the services and products generated by
Earth's ecosystems. Regen Registry coupled with Regen Ledger, an
ecological blockchain-based ledger, create a new platform for farmers to
monetize their ecological data while receiving rewards for sustainable
practices. By improving the understanding of the state of our land,
oceans, and watersheds and enabling rewards for verified positive
changes, Regen Network catalyzes the regeneration of our ecosystems.

Regen Network was launched in Q2, 2018 and is headquartered in Great
Barrington, Massachusetts.

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}}

\begin{quote}
The Program Guide details the general requirements and specifications
for the quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV),
project registration, and issuance of credits on Regen Registry. The
common characteristic of all Regen Registry credits is that they are all
nature-based solutions, and each can provide one or more ecosystem
services, including GHG emissions reductions and removals,
biodiversity/habitat protection, improvement in water quality, and
more\footnote{Note, the taxonomy of carbon markets and climate
  mitigation varies from ecosystem services}.

The Program Guide establishes the programmatic structure of Regen
Registry, including credit classes and methodologies, the project
registration process, project eligibility, and the issuance of tradable
environmental assets to projects. This guide is intended to be used by
Project Proponents, buyers, Monitors, Verifiers, and all other
stakeholders.

Regen Registry aims to maximize flexibility and usability for Project
Proponents while maintaining the environmental integrity and scientific
rigor necessary to ensure that projects developed against its credit
classes and methodologies are of the highest quality.

Project Proponents developing a project for registration on Regen
Registry shall follow this Program Guide and must apply a Regen Registry
approved credit class and methodology.

Project Proponents and other interested stakeholders should refer to the
Regen Registry website for the latest version of the Program Guide,
methodologies, document templates, and other guidance. Regen Registry
will inform Project Proponents with active projects directly to avoid
any potential disruptions.

  Description
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
Regen Registry is an open source ecosystem services registry in which
Project Proponents can register projects, apply for credits, and
transfer and sell credits to buyers. Buyers can resell or retire credits
(in the case of carbon credits). Each credit vintage issued has a unique
ID, is project-based, is geospatially tagged and independently
verified\footnote{If an independent verification is required by the
  respective Credit Class}.

Regen Registry aims to provide an open source, vertically integrated
solution that provides:

a) Digital MRV - software infrastructure that provides monitoring tools
- through in-house remote sensing and interoperability with 3rd party
tools - that streamline the cost and issuance of credits.

b) Marketing platform - showcases the unique story of each project,
highlighting the land stewards, the impact on the land and environment;
provides buyers and policy makers with impact analytics on a portfolio
(regional, national, and global) of key ecological indicators.

c) Marketplace and exchange (trading platform) - sellers offer their
credits for sale; buyers purchase from one or multiple projects and
build a portfolio; the system provides a clearing \hl{and settlement
infrastructure including} payments and billing.

d) Regen Ledger - a custom-built ecological ledger using blockchain
technology where credits are issued and transferred, and monitoring and
verification claims are recorded as immutable records.

Each layer offered within the Regen Registry is standalone and Project
Proponents can choose which ones to use. For example, a Project
Proponent can choose to perform the monitoring in-house, based on the
methodology guidelines, rather than use a Monitor that leverages our
software stack. That said, integrated use of all layers will enable
significant advantages in ease-of-use, effectiveness, and cost
efficiency.

  User-Centric Design
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
Relative to their potential, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU) carbon credits have seen limited adoption in regulatory and
voluntary markets. Historically, the supply of these credits has been
limited because credit design has not incorporated enough feedback from
land stewards, resulting in credit requirements that were complicated,
expensive and/or time consuming. Regen Registry follows a user centric
design of credit classes and methodologies with input not only from
buyers but also land stewards and project developers.

\begin{quote}
Regen Registry is built on the principles of openness, collaboration,
accountability, user centric design, transparency, responsiveness, and
participation. This is applied to Credit Class and Methodology design,
provision of monitoring and verification services, integration with
other registries, and with 3rd-party service providers.

Regen Registry relies on a software implementation that includes two
layers: a) Regen Registry platform - a centralized software layer that
provides user accounts, project pages, administrative functions and b)
Regen Ledger\footnote{Integration of Regen Registry and Regen Ledger is
  targeted for Q2 2021} - a decentralized software layer that is used to
issue, transfer, and retire credits and tracks all pertinent monitoring,
reporting and verification (MRV) information as immutable records.

Regen Registry is operated by Regen Network Development, Inc (RND), a
private for-profit company. Regen Ledger is a public decentralized
ledger that is not owned by a single entity (including RND) and is a
Digital Commons\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)}{\ul{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\_commons\_(economics)}}}
that is operated by a network of independent stakeholders called
Validators that are incentivized to maintain the integrity of the
underlying ecological data and credits tracked on the ledger. Regen
Network believes this is the best way to maintain long term data
integrity, auditability, transparency, and viability, and enables a just
allocation of resources and sustained regeneration of ecological
ecosystems (see blog post\footnote{\href{https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3}{\ul{https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3}}}
for more details).

Regen Registry is committed to fully comply with all relevant U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) standards and regulations.

In the event that RND dissolves, the Regen Registry's contractual
agreements bind both project developers and buyers to uphold any
outstanding contractual commitments as if the two slides are direct
parties to the contracts.

\hypertarget{additionality}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Additionality}
}{Additionality }}\label{additionality}}

\begin{quote}
The concept of additionality is often raised as a vital consideration
for quantifying project-based GHG reductions. Additionality is a
criteria that requires GHG reductions to only be recognized for project
activities that would not have ``happened anyway.''

While there is general agreement that additionality is important, its
meaning and application remain difficult to define, frequently framed
with imprecise language, and in many cases subject to
interpretation.\footnote{\href{https://ghginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AdditionalityPaper_Part-1ver3FINAL.pdf}{\ul{https://ghginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AdditionalityPaper\_Part-1ver3FINAL.pdf}}}

Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, a multi-stakeholder partnership of
businesses,

NGOs, governments, and academics convened by the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Resources Institute
(WRI), does not require demonstration of additionality, but instead
recommends incorporating it as an implicit part of the procedures used
to estimate baseline emissions\footnote{\href{https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg_project_accounting.pdf}{\ul{https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg\_project\_accounting.pdf}}}.
Depending on the methodology, as appropriate for each context, this may
be either a performance-based approach or a project-based approach,
using either a static or a dynamic baseline, and takes into account
different considerations and barriers to adoption.

Each Credit Class shall stipulate the relevant additionality
requirements to that credit.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{permanence}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Permanence}
}{Permanence }}\label{permanence}}

\begin{quote}
In GHG accounting, permanence refers to the risk that a carbon reservoir
may be subject to gradual long-term or sudden disruptive release that
will reverse the benefit that occurred as a result of project
implementation. GHG emissions reductions from terrestrial sources and
sinks may not be permanent if a project has exposure to risk factors
such as intentional or unintentional events that result in emissions
into the atmosphere of sequestered CO2e for which offset credits were
issued. Terrestrial projects have the potential for GHG removals to be
reversed upon exposure to risk factors, including both unintentional
reversals (e.g. fire, flood, and insect infestation) and intentional
reversals (e.g., landowners choosing to discontinue land management
and/or participate in an activity that reverses the
sequestration).\footnote{\href{https://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/american-carbon-registry-standard-3/acr-standard-v6-0-may-2019-public-comment-version.pdf}{\ul{https://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/american-carbon-registry-standard-3/acr-standard-v6-0-may-2019-public-comment-version.pdf}}}

Land use-based and forestry projects may require the Project Proponent
to register covenants on their land and/or restrict land use for 40 to
100 years post credit issuance\footnote{\href{https://nori.com/resources/how-nori-works}{\ul{https://nori.com/resources/how-nori-works}}}.
This approach is not financially viable for most Project Proponents as
the covenant often results in a reduction in the market value of the
land that is greater than the potential additional revenues from credit
sales.

Further, there is no length of time, short of perpetual, that is equated
with the assurance of permanence, nor is there a sound scientific basis
or accepted international standard around any number of years that
equates to an emission reduction/removal being permanent.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Avoiding Double
Counting}}{Avoiding Double Counting}}\label{avoiding-double-counting}}

\begin{quote}
Double counting refers to situations where a single GHG emission
reduction or removal is used more than once to demonstrate achievement
of mitigation targets and/or pledges typically made by
corporations/entities and countries. Double counting can occur either as
double issuance, double sale, or double claiming.

Double claiming is of concern in international carbon trading and in
determining Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris
Agreement\footnote{\href{https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement}{\ul{https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement}}},
when an emission reduction is counted once by the country of origin when
reporting its emissions inventory, and again by the receiving country
(or other entity) when justifying emissions above its pledged climate
effort. In the absence of rules, a country of origin could reduce
emissions to meet its pledged effort and transfer those to a recipient;
the recipient could then claim those same reductions to meet its pledged
effort. In that case, only one reduction has actually occurred, but it
is being claimed twice. Analyses indicate that such double-claiming
could eliminate the entire climate benefit of all the NDCs.\footnote{\href{https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/double-counting-handbook.pdf}{\ul{https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/double-counting-handbook.pdf}}}

Regen Registry has program rules and operational processes to mitigate
these double counting risks. To avoid double claiming, all credits will
be tracked on Regen Ledger, a custom-built ecological ledger leveraging
blockchain technology (specifically the Cosmos SDK\footnote{\href{https://cosmos.network/}{\ul{https://cosmos.network/}}}),
which provides public immutable records for transactions. The data on
Regen Ledger is available for external scrutiny and validation and
provides a digital audit trail for transactions, at any given point in
time. Examples include who was issued credits and their location, who
currently owns credits, when each credit was retired, and who claimed
the GHG benefit and their location.

As defined in this section, verification will be conducted by an
independent verifier chosen by the Project Proponent and approved by
Regen Registry.

Regen Registry seeks a balance between adequate assurances, the
overhead, and costs associated with verification. Therefore, each Credit

ecosystem, best management practice and/or locale(s) it pertains to.
Regen Registry retains the right to adapt the requirements and provide

Regen Registry aims to democratize and invigorate the design of

and allow Credit Designers to modify and upgrade these as needed and
appropriate. These include:
\end{quote}

  \end{quote}
\item

\item
  \begin{quote}
  Reporting and compliance requirements
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
The Registry Program Guide and the Credit Class templates provide the
guidelines for creating new credits, thus enabling innovation while
maintaining a high standard of rigor.

While a subset of Credit Classes might be developed by RND, the
intention is to build a vibrant community of Credit Designers that will
take the lead going forward.

Regen Registry aims to create a broad set of Credit Classes that cover
different ecosystems, geographical regions and localities, and are
tailored for different stakeholders (e.g. smallholder farmers, corporate
farms, indigineous communities, conservation organizations, etc).

One of our key assumptions is that creating a one-size-fits-all solution
is suboptimal and does not tap into collective potential. Ecological
systems are inherently complex. Regenerative farming, grazing ,and
conservation are complex, nuanced, and locale specific. Similarly, the
needs and risk profile of credit buyers vary substantially depending on
the size of the company, its sector, climate goals, etc. As such, we
believe a successful solution needs to leverage commonalities and best
practices, while simultaneously allowing for flexibility in design.

\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Credit Class draft - the Credit Designer submits the proposed new or
  modified Credit Class to Regen Registry based on the appropriate
  template. Regen Registry reviews the draft, asks for clarifications,
  and points out corrections that are needed.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Beta (optional) - once the necessary clarifications and corrections
  are made, the Credit Designer can choose to move it to beta status. At
  this point, a Project Proponent can apply for a project using the beta
  Credit Class. Regen Registry encourages Credit Designers to collect
  feedback from Project Proponents as they go through the beta process,
  in order to ensure viability of the Credit Class. Feedback from the
  Project Proponent on the proposed Credit Class will be documented by
  Regen Registry and incorporated into the subsequent stages in the
  approval process.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Technical review committee - the revised Credit Class is provided to a
  technical review committee that Regen Registry assembles consisting of
  independent and impartial subject matter experts. Regen Registry
  actively identifies and qualifies candidate committee members, and
  publicly solicits applications from interested parties. Once the
  review is complete, the committee lead compiles the comments and
  recommendations from the committee, and prepares a summary report.
  Regen Registry delivers to the Credit Designers the summary report, to
  which they must respond by incorporating revisions and/or documenting
  justifications for the proposed approach. Timing and cost of the
  technical review committee depends on the complexity, scope, and
  quality of the Credit Class and the availability of technical
  reviewers.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Public consultation process (optional) - Regen Registry coordinates a
  public consultation process. The Credit Class is posted publicly on
  the Regen Registry website for a minimum of 30 days inviting public
  comments. During this period, the Credit Designer may also choose to
  conduct a webinar to present the draft Credit Class and solicit
  additional comments. At the conclusion of the public comment period,
  the comments are compiled into a report and sent to the Credit
  Designer, who then has 30 days to respond to comments in writing and
  incorporate relevant feedback to a revised version, which is then
  posted on the Regen Registry website.

\item
  \begin{quote}
  Beta (optional) - once the necessary clarifications and corrections
  are made, the Methodology Developer can choose to move it to beta
  status. At this point, a Project Proponent can apply for a project
  using the beta methodology. Regen Registry encourages Methodology
  Developers to collect feedback from Project Proponents as they go
  through the beta in order to ensure viability of the methodology.
  Feedback from the Project Proponent on the proposed methodology will
  be documented by Regen Registry and incorporated into the public
  consultation process.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Public consultation process - Regen Registry coordinates a public
  consultation process. The methodology is posted publicly on the Regen
  Registry website for a minimum of 30 days inviting public comments.
  During this period, the Methodology Developer may also choose to
  conduct a webinar to present the draft methodology and solicit
  additional comments. At the conclusion of the public comment period,
  the comments are compiled into a report and sent to the Methodology
  Developer, who then has 30 days to respond to comments in writing and
  incorporate relevant feedback to a revised version, which is then
  posted on the Regen Registry website.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Scientific peer review process - the revised methodology is provided
  to a team of independent subject matter experts for a scientific peer
  review process. Regen Registry may consult a technical committee in
  the selection of impartial reviewers with the applicable subject
  matter expertise. Regen Registry actively identifies and qualifies
  candidate reviewers, and publicly solicits applications from
  interested parties. Once the review is complete, the lead reviewer
  compiles comments and recommendations from the peer review team, and
  prepares a summary report. Regen Registry delivers to the Methodology
  Developer the peer reviewed report, to which she must respond by
  incorporating revisions and/or documenting justifications for the
  proposed approach. Generally, several rounds of peer review are
  necessary. Timing and cost of peer review depends on the complexity,
  scope, and quality of the methodology and the availability of peer
  reviewers.

  Introduction
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
Co-benefits of climate change mitigation, as defined in the 4th
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), are the positive benefits related to the reduction of GHG.
Examples of such climate mitigation policies include improved energy
efficiency of plants, renewable energy uptake and fuel switching, which
might enable a range of co-benefits, such as air-pollution impacts,
technological innovation, energy-supply security through increased
energy diversity, reduced fuel cost, and employment possibilities.

In the context of AFOLU projects, a variety of co-benefits are possible
including environmental, social, economic, indigineous rights, and many
more.

Interlinked with co-benefits is the shared blueprint the UN adopted in
2015 for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. At its heart
are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\footnote{\href{https://sdgs.un.org/goals}{\ul{https://sdgs.un.org/goals}}},
which are an urgent call for action by all countries in a global
partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations
must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education,
reduce inequality, and spur economic growth -- all while tackling
climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

  Credit Class requirements
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
Regen Registry is encouraging Credit Developers to include co-benefits
in all Credit Classes. This applies to both GHG removal credits and
other types of credits (e.g. biodiversity). In that sense we hold the
``co-benefit'' term loosely in the sense that all benefits are
important, whether they are tied directly to climate change mitigation
and GHG removal or not.

Therefore, each Credit Class shall identify the applicable co-benefits
and how to measure and verify them. To that end, Regen Registry will
introduce in the future a framework and/or taxonomy to help Credit
Developers identify co-benefits and SDGs related to certain types of
projects, and stipulate how to measure and verify them. These
co-benefits and SDGs will be shown on Regen Registry to highlight the
broader impact of each project.
