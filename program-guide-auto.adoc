== Introduction

____
Every day, business is done while neglecting our most important
partners: farmers, land stewards, and the Earth. The result are
destructive global consequences like climate change, desertification,
biodiversity loss and resource depletion that affect nearly every aspect
of human life. The United Nations FAO estimates [.mark]#33% of the
Earth's soils are already degraded and over 90% could become degraded by
2050#footnote:[[.mark]#FAO and ITPS, 2015; IPBES, 2018#][.mark]#.#

The price tag to ‘fix’ these problems is estimated to be in the
trillions, paralyzing global efforts to quickly address climate change.
There may be nothing of more critical importance today than the
regeneration of the world’s ecosystems.
____

Land Stewards, the stewards of our global landscapes, offer one of the
most powerful pathways for reversing climate change and unlocking a
massive untapped market in the world: the services and products
generated by Earth’s ecosystems. Regen Registry, coupled with Regen
Ledger, an ecological blockchain-based ledger, creates a new platform
for Land Stewards to monetize their ecological data while receiving
rewards for regenerative practices. By improving the understanding of
the state of our land, oceans, and watersheds and enabling rewards for
verified positive changes, Regen Network catalyzes the regeneration of
our ecosystems.

____
Regen Network Development, PBC was launched in Q2, 2018 and is
headquartered in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The mainnet blockchain
of Regen Ledger was launched in April 2021.
____

== Overview

The Regen Registry Program Guide details the general requirements and
specifications for the quantification, monitoring, reporting and
verification (MRV), project registration, and issuance of credits on
Regen Registry. The common characteristic of all Regen Registry credits
is that they are all nature-based solutions, and each can provide one or
more ecosystem services, including GHG emissions reductions and
removals, biodiversity/habitat protection, improvement in water quality,
and morefootnote:[Note, the taxonomy of carbon markets and climate
mitigation varies from ecosystem services].

The Program Guide establishes the requirements for the use of Regen
Registry, including the development and use of credit classes and
methodologies, the project registration process, project eligibility,
and the issuance of tradable environmental assets to projects. This
guide is intended to be used by Credit Designers, Methodology
Developers, Credit Class Admins, Registry Agents, Project Proponents,
Buyers, Monitors, Verifiers, and all other stakeholders.

Regen Registry aims to maximize flexibility and usability for Project
Proponents while maintaining the environmental integrity and scientific
rigor necessary to ensure that projects developed against its credit
classes and methodologies are of the highest quality.

Project Proponents and other interested stakeholders should refer to the
https://registry.regen.network/v/regen-registry-handbook/[[.underline]#Regen
Registry Handbook#] for the latest version of the Program Guide, Credit
Classes, Approved Methodologies, document templates, and other guidance.

== Definitions

=== *Aggregate Project* 

=== A project in which multiple independently managed projects at different sites or locations within the same geographic region are registered together as a single project to strategically reduce the amount of data required for monitoring, reporting, and verification. 

=== Approved Methodology

A methodology (or set of methodologies) that has been approved for use
within Regen Registry, or more specifically, within a Regen Registry
approved Credit Class.

==== *Baseline Scenario*

The hypothetical situation that represents the state or condition of an
ecological system (like a habitat, species population, or ecosystem
function) that would be expected in the absence of a proposed Project
Activity. The Baseline scenario serves as a reference point against
which outcomes resulting from the Project Activity can be measured to
determine the net impact or benefit of those efforts. A baseline can be
static, dynamic, project specific, or based on performance standard (or
a combination of
those)footnote:[https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg_project_accounting.pdf[[.underline]#https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg_project_accounting.pdf#]].

==== *Buffer Pool*

A tool to mitigate credit class or project-specific risk factors
associated with unintentional or intentional reversal events, or
overestimation of credits issued. Buffer pools hold credits that cannot
be sold to buyers, and reserve credits for potential cancellation from
the Registry System to maintain accurate credit accounting.

==== *Buyer*

An individual or organization that is purchasing credits from the
registry.

==== *Cancelation*

The permanent removal of an ecological credit from circulation in the
Regen Registry System for purposes other than retirement. Reasons for
cancellation could include reversals, non-compliance with Regen Registry
or Credit Class standards, or migrating credits to a different registry
system.

==== *Credit* 

A digital asset, representing a quantifiable unit of measurement either
tied to ecological or social benefit resulting from the implementation
of a Project Activity, or tied to the successful implementation of a
Project Activity rather than an explicitly measured benefit. Credits
within the Registry System are tracked on Regen Ledger, and can exist in
a Tradable, Retired, or Canceled state. Credits on the Regen Registry
can also sometimes be referred to as tokens.

==== *Credit Class*

A standard or
protocolfootnote:[https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/protocols-standards/[[.underline]#Protocols
and Standards&#44; Carbon Offset Guide#]] which details the procedures
for project registration and credit issuance for a specific set of
Project Activities which provide ecological and social benefits. Such
benefits could include GHG removal, emission reduction, environmental
stewardship, and enhanced ecosystem function. Credit Classes define the
structure, procedures, and prerequisites for registering projects and
issuing credits. Typically, a Credit Class will establish one or more
Approved Methodologies used to measure the impact of Project Activities.
It also lays down the programmatic rules and stipulations for project
registration and credit issuance, such as project eligibility criteria,
Buffer Pool management and Verification requirements.. In certain
instances, the process for measuring, reporting, and verifying
ecological and social benefits might be directly integrated into a
Credit class, rather than being outlined in a separate methodology.

Within the Regen Registry, each Credit Class operates as an independent
standard or crediting program. This means that every Credit Class can
possess its unique governance and issuance structure, buffer pool
requirements, project registration prerequisites, and distinct group of
project actors, all of which operate autonomously from other Regen
Registry Credit Classes.

Credit Classes on Regen Registry also have a specific set of features
provided by Regen Ledger (the Registry System used by Regen Registry).
These include:

* {blank}
+
____
A governance body known as the Credit Class Admin
____
* {blank}
+
____
A set of on-chain anchored metadata defining the rules and regulations
for this Credit Class, as well as a list of Approved Methodologies which
may be used by projects registered in this Credit Class
____
* {blank}
+
____
One or more on-chain Registry Agents who manage project registration and
credit issuance
____

=== Credit Class Admin

An individual, organization, or group of individuals/organizations
(private or public) that manages the rules and conditions necessary to
issue credits under a Credit Class. The Credit Class Admin is
responsible for maintaining the credit class protocol, list of approved
methodologies, and subsequent documentation in accordance with the Regen
Registry Program Guide. Additionally, the Credit Class Admin maintains
the list of approved Registry Agents, maintains on-chain metadata for
the Credit Class, and (if applicable) manages Buffer Pool Accounts for
the Credit Class. To the extent that active management of the above
allows, Credit Class Admins are responsible for ensuring integrity of
all ecological claims accounted for in the Credit Class.

Credit Class Admins have sole control over the above on-chain components
of a Credit Class, and can also transfer Credit Class Admin privileges
to a new address at their own discretion. Credit Classes may be delisted
from Regen Registry if a Credit Class Admin falls out of compliance with
the Regen Registry Program Guide.

==== *Credit Designer*

An individual or organization that develops a new Credit Class or
updates an existing one.

==== *Crediting Period* 

The finite length of time for which a Project Plan is valid, and during
which a project can generate credits.

==== *Credit Vintage*

The Credit Vintage refers to the year in which ecological credits were
issued. Credit Vintages can generally refer to the year in which GHG
emission reductions/removals or other ecological and social benefits
occurred, however, the exact time frame might span multiple years for
longer Reporting Periods.

==== *Issuance* 

Issuance is the act of recording and assigning initial ownership of
quantified ecological outcomes and carbon offsets in the form of a
digital asset, known as credits, on the Regen Registry System, a public
blockchain for recording all data, information, and transaction history
related to carbon credits and other environmentally-related assets.

==== *Land Steward* 

The individual or organization that is implementing a Project Activity.
This can be a farmer, rancher, conservationist, forester, fisherman,
etc.

==== *Land Owner*

The individual or organization that holds title to the land where the
project is occurring.

==== *Methodology*

A specific set of scientifically based criteria and procedures which
outline the process for monitoring, reporting, verification of
ecological and social benefits and practices for a defined Project
Activity or set of Project Activities. This can include setting project
boundaries, determining the Baseline Scenario, quantifying net GHG
emission reductions or removals, measuring improvements in ecosystem
function, and specifying monitoring procedures.

==== *Methodology Developer*

An individual or organization that develops a new Methodology or updates
an existing one.

==== *Monitor*

An individual or organization that is contracted to measure the benefits
/ indicators defined in a given Credit Class based on the stipulations
in the Approved Methodology.

==== *Monitoring*

[.mark]#The ongoing, systematic process of collecting and analyzing data
to track the ecological and social benefits provided by a Project
Activity, following the guidelines of an Approved Methodology.#

==== *Permanence Reversal Buffer*

A dedicated Buffer Pool account that allocates a percentage of credits
from each issuance in order to mitigate permanence related reversal
risk, i.e. GHG removal reversal that has occurred over the permanence
period of the project.

==== *Project Activity*

The specific land management practice or conservation activity employed
by a project to support ecological or social benefits.

==== *Project Area*

The geographic area in which Project Activities are implemented.

==== *Project Boundary*

The geography within which the direct and indirect environmental,
economic, and social impacts of the project are accounted for. This
includes the Project Area as well as areas that may be indirectly
affected, including potential offsite changes in GHG emissions or other
ecological impacts attributable to the project’s implementation.

==== *Project Developer*

The individual or organization responsible for the detailed management
of the project. The project developer, who can be the land steward or a
third party, handles detailed planning, design, construction and
implementation of the project.

==== *Project Plan*

The document used to apply for Project Registration under a given Credit
Class. The Project Plan describes the Project Activity or Activities,
demonstrates project eligibility requirements, establishes project
boundaries, specifies project stakeholders, justifies application of the
Credit Class and Methodology, and more.

==== *Project Proponent*

The individual or organization that advocates for a project, identifies
its requirements, and drives its initiation. The Project Proponent
serves as the main point of contact with the Registry Agent throughout
the course of the project and is responsible for initiating project
registration, submission of all materials required by the Credit Class,
Methodology, and Program Guide, and coordinating project actors. The
Project Proponent must ensure correctness and compliance of all
submitted documentation with the standards outlined in the Credit Class,
Methodology, and Regen Registry Program Guide prior to to ensure credit
quality. The Project Proponent receives the credits upon issuance and is
responsible for coordinating sale and distribution between project
actors.

==== *Project Start Date* 

The date on which the project commences and begins generating and
accounting for GHG emission reduction or removals or other ecological
and social benefits. The Project Start Date may be before or after the
project registration date as stipulated in the Credit Class. The Project
Start Date marks the beginning of the Crediting Period.

==== *Regen Registry*

A comprehensive program, platform, and process designed to establish
community standards and legal frameworks for quantifying, monitoring,
and trading ecological credits and managing other types of ecological
claims. Regen Registry offers processes and tools for setting standards
for Methodology and Credit Class development and approval, establishing
and upholding frameworks for decision-making processes and appeals, and
overseeing the use of the Regen Registry System by stakeholders using
Credit Classes registered under the Regen Registry.

Central to its operation is the active engagement of the community.
Designed with modularity in mind, the Regen Registry promotes shared
decision-making among stakeholders. These stakeholders have the ability
to propose and vote on pivotal decisions, form committees to supervise
specific facets of the registry process, and collaboratively address
disputes or challenges. As of Q3 2023, the stewardship of the Regen
Registry is undertaken by RND PBC.

===  *Registry Agent*

The individual or organization appointed by the Credit Class Admin that
operates the Registry System to register projects and/or issue credits
under a given Credit Class. The Registry Agent is responsible for
maintaining accurate accounting and ensuring compliance of registered
projects, issued credits, and other ecosystem service claims as set
forth in the Regen Registry Program Guide, Credit Class, Approved
Methodology, and Project Plan. The Registry Agent is also responsible
for ensuring updates made to the Registry Program, Credit Class,
Approved Methodology and Project Plan are, if applicable, applied to
existing projects in a way that is transparent and fair.

Selection of the Registry Agent is a crucial part of establishing
checks-and-balances for credit issuance. As such, acceptance of Credit
Classes to be registered under Regen Registry is contingent upon having
a Registry Agent that has been approved or appointed by RND PBC as the
stewards of Regen Registry.

==== *Registry System*

The technical infrastructure responsible for tracking information and
claims related to ecological state. This system encompasses specific
business logic, computer code, and programs that facilitate certain
functions associated with the Regen Registry. While the Regen Registry
sets the standards and frameworks, the Registry System provides the
technical means to implement these functions. Built atop Regen Ledger,
the Registry System's capabilities include, but are not limited to,
registering projects, monitoring the issuance, ownership, transfer, and
retirement (or cancellation) of ecological credits, anchoring and
signing data, and transparently tracking decision-making practices.

Regen Ledger serves as the foundational blockchain layer upon which the
Registry System operates to ensure transparency, security, and
decentralization verification of all transactions and activities. The
Regen Ledger is open-source and is publicly accessible.

==== *Reporting Period*

A period of time following the methodology guidelines in which
Monitoring and Verification activities are completed.

==== *Retirement*

The permanent removal of an ecological credit from circulation in the
Registry System after it has been claimed.

==== *Reversal* 

A situation where project outcomes, such as carbon removals,
improvements in biodiversity, or successful implementation of a practice
are unexpectedly reversed. Reversal events can happen due to a variety
of reasons, including natural disasters, changes in land use, poor
project management, or failure to comply with project protocols.

==== *Site*

The location where a project implements the Project Activity or
Activities. A project area does not need to be continuous and can have
multiple sites.

==== *Validation* 

The systematic, independent third-party assessment of a project prior to
registration to determine whether a project conforms to the rules and
requirements outlined in the Regen Registry Program Guide, Credit Class,
and Approved Methodology, and evaluates the reasonableness of
assumptions, limitations, and methods that support claims about the
future outcome of Project Activities.

==== *Verification*

The systematic, independent, and documented assessment by a qualified
and impartial third party of the Monitor’s assertions for a specific
Reporting Period.

*Verifier*

An individual or organization that is contracted to execute the
verification requirements stipulated in a given Credit Class.

____
Regen Registry accepts projects from locations worldwide, provided they
conform to an approved Credit Class and Methodology.
____

==== Project Activities

____
Regen Registry was developed to be a catalyst for ecosystem regeneration
around the globe using blockchain, decentralized finance, and other Web
3.0 tools. To accomplish this, we are developing innovative ways to
financially support people working to improve and maintain ecosystem
health through the use of nature-based solutions (NbS). We follow a
definition of NbS that is similar to the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) definition but we replace “_sustainably_”
with “_regeneratively_” to define NbS as:

_“actions to protect, [regeneratively] manage and restore natural or
modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and
adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity
benefits”_.

This definition includes, but is not limited to, projects reducing
negative direct impacts that humans have on ecosystem function,
improving climate adaptation, and reducing global warming. Examples of
projects that we support will be reflected in our growing list of
methodologies and projects.

Proponents to collect data for monitoring, verification and reporting
and the need for assurances from credit Buyers. To that end, Regen
Registry encourages an adaptive approach to methodology development that
will provide different levels of assurances to cater to different needs
of credit Buyers.
____

==== Security

____
RND will conduct security audits of major releases of its software,
including Regen Ledger and Registry System, to ensure the data integrity
and fidelity of credit ownership and the underlying MRV data.
____

==== Open Source and Open Data

____
Following the collaboration principle above, RND is a strong proponent
of open-source software and open data. We firmly believe that in order
to achieve the best results, provide transparency, ensure fair
governance, and invite collaboration from multiple stakeholders, we need
to develop open source software and share our research data openly. Our
software code repositories are available on
GitHubfootnote:[https://github.com/regen-network/[[.underline]#https://github.com/regen-network/#]].
____

==== User-Centric Design

____
Relative to their potential, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU) carbon credits have seen limited adoption in regulatory and
voluntary markets. Historically, the supply of these credits has been
limited because credit design has not incorporated enough feedback from
land stewards, resulting in credit requirements that were complicated,
expensive and/or time consuming. Regen Registry follows a user centric
design of credit classes and methodologies with input not only from
buyers but also land stewards and project developers.
____

== Governance

Regen Registry is built on the principles of openness, collaboration,
accountability, user centric design, transparency, responsiveness, and
participation. This is applied to Credit Class administration and
Methodology design, provision of monitoring and verification services,
integration with other registries, and with 3rd-party service providers.

Credits issued under Regen Registry rely on a software implementation
that includes two layers:

[loweralpha]
. {blank}
+
____
Regen Marketplace - a centralized software layer that provides user
interfaces for managing accounts, project pages, buy/sell functionality,
administrative functions; and
____
. {blank}
+
____
Regen Registry System - a decentralized software layer that is used to
issue, transfer, and retire credits and tracks all pertinent monitoring,
reporting and verification (MRV) information as immutable records.
____

Regen Registry is operated by Regen Network Development, PBC (RND), a
private for-profit company. Regen Ledger is a public decentralized
ledger that is not owned by a single entity (including RND) and is a
Digital
Commonsfootnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)[[.underline]#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)#]]
that is operated by a network of independent stakeholders called
Validators that are incentivized to maintain the integrity of the
underlying ecological data and credits tracked on the ledger. Regen
Network believes this is the best way to maintain long term data
integrity, auditability, transparency, and viability, and enables a just
allocation of resources and sustained regeneration of ecological
ecosystems (see blog
postfootnote:[https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3[[.underline]#https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3#]]
for more details).

Regen Registry is committed to fully complying with all relevant U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) standards and other applicable regulations.

In the event that RND dissolves, the Regen Registry’s contractual
agreements bind both Registry Agents and Project Proponents and buyers
to uphold any outstanding contractual commitments.

== Credit Classes and Methodologies

Regen Registry aims to democratize and invigorate the design of
ecological credits. To that end we are separating out the typical set of
definitions that are part and parcel of most registry standards and
allow Credit and Methodology Designers to modify and upgrade these as
needed and appropriate. These include:

* {blank}
+
____
Credit definition
____
* {blank}
+
____
Project eligibility requirements
____
* {blank}
+
____
GHG accounting related requirements including permanence, leakage and
additionality.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Verification requirements
____
* {blank}
+
____
Reporting and compliance requirements
____

The Regen Registry Program Guide and the Credit Class templates provide
the guidelines for creating new credits, thus enabling innovation while
maintaining a high standard of rigor.

While a subset of Credit Classes might be developed by RND, the
intention is to build a vibrant community of Credit Designers that will
take the lead going forward.

Regen Registry aims to steward a broad set of Credit Classes that cover
different ecosystems, geographical regions and localities, and are
tailored for different stakeholders (e.g. smallholder farmers, corporate
farms, indigenous communities, conservation organizations, etc).

One of our key assumptions is that creating a one-size-fits-all solution
is suboptimal and does not tap into collective potential. Ecological
systems are inherently complex. Regenerative farming, grazing ,and
conservation are complex, nuanced, and locale specific. Similarly, the
needs and risk profile of credit buyers vary substantially depending on
the size of the company, its sector, climate goals, etc. As such, we
believe a successful solution needs to leverage commonalities and best
practices, while simultaneously allowing for flexibility in design.

=== New Credit Classes and Methodologies 

[arabic]
. {blank}
+
____
All new Credit Classes and Methodologies must go through an Expert Peer
Review and Public Comment process The requirements for Expert Peer
Review and Public Comment are outlined in the
https://registry.regen.network/v/regen-registry-handbook[[.underline]#Regen
Registry Handbook#].
____
. {blank}
+
____
Regen Registry may grandfather in new Methodologies or Credit Classes
into the Regen Registry Methodology Library from another Registry if the
applicant submitting the Methodology or Credit Class can demonstrate the
Methodology has gone through a process of similar merit to the one
above.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Regen Registry must document the entire Credit Class or Methodology
process for Expert Peer Review or Public Comment including submitted
versions, responses of reviewers, comments and responses of the
Methodology or Credit Designer, and corresponding changes made to each
version Credit Class or Methodology at each stage.
____
. {blank}
+
____
While successful completion of Expert Peer Review and Public Comment (or
sufficient alternative) is a necessary prerequisite for approval of a
Credit Class or Methodology for use under Regen Registry, such
completion does not guarantee approval, as approval may also be
contingent upon other factors to ensure credit quality. Other criteria,
such as the appointment of adequately qualified organizations as the
Credit Class Admin and Registry Agent, and ensuring the proposed Credit
Class upholds the standards of integrity, also influence the final
decision.
____

=== Modifications to an Approved Credit Class or Methodology

==== Proposed Modifications to Approved Credit Classes and Methodologies

[arabic, start=5]
. {blank}
+
____
Credit Class Admins may propose modifications to an existing approved
Credit Class or Methodology where they maintain the guidelines
stipulated in the Regen Registry Program Guide. Credit Class and/or
Methodology modifications may be submitted for review to Regen Registry.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Regen Registry, currently managed by RND, will review the extent of the
modification and determine what steps in the approval process outlined
in Section 5.1 are required to approve modifications.
____
. {blank}
+
____
If changes to Credit Class or Methodology are approved by the Regen
Registry, Credit Class Admins are required to indicate the changes made
to the Credit Class or Methodology and release the updated document as
an updated version.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Upon releasing an updated version of a Credit Class or Methodology,
Credit Class Admins are compelled to specify whether the updated version
necessitates enforcement/updates for pre-existing projects registered
under the same Credit Class. If such enforcement is required, Admins
must supply a comprehensive justification detailing the reasons behind
the implementation of these changes.
____

==== Credit Class and Methodology Update Requirements for Existing Projects

[arabic, start=9]
. {blank}
+
____
If a new version of a Credit Class or Methodology is released, the
Registry Agent must inform the Project Proponent of any updates made to
the Credit Class or Methodology and indicate if changes are to be made
to the project.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Project Proponents are required to implement changes to the best of
their ability.
____
. {blank}
+
____
If a Project Proponent is unable to implement changes for an updated
version of a Credit Class or Methodology, they must submit an
application for variance to the Credit Class Admin to remain under a
previous Credit Class or Methodology version. Applications for variance
must state why the Project Proponent is unable to implement the new
changes under the new version of the Credit Class. Such applications
must be approved by the Credit Class Admin. Projects with approved
applications for variance shall be denoted as issued under the previous
version of the Credit Class.
____

=== Governance of Adding and Removing Credit Classes and Methodologies to the Regen Registry

____
Regen Registry, currently managed by RND, will govern the process of
adding new Credit Classes and Methodologies per the above process. In
the future our aim is to move towards an independent, decentralized
governance of these Credit Classes and Methodologies by a broad set of
stakeholders, including subject matter experts, land stewards, project
developers, monitors, and verifiers.

If a Credit Class Admin manages a Credit Class or Methodology in a way
that deviates from the rules as stipulated in the Regen Registry Program
Guide, Regen Registry may revoke its approval of said Credit Class or
Methodology, removing it from Regen Registry. For avoidance of doubt,
the Credit Class or Methodology would still exist as a managed on-chain
credit class on Regen Network, but would no longer be recognized under
the Regen Registry Program.
____

=== Access and Use of Credit Classes and Methodologies

[arabic, start=12]
. {blank}
+
____
All Methodologies and Credit Classes registered under the Regen Registry
must be either open source or open access, as designated by the original
Methodology Developer or Credit Designer.
____

* {blank}
+
____
Open Source Methodologies/Credit Classes are ones where the methodology
and all subsequent software, tools, and modules, are publicly available
and freely available for use, modification, and distribution.
____

Credit Designer.
____
[arabic]
. {blank}
+
____
For every new Methodology or Credit Class submitted to Regen Registry,
the submitting party must explicitly declare whether their Methodology
or Credit Class is Open Source or Open Access at the time of
registration. This declaration forms part of the official registration
documentation and cannot be changed retroactively.
____
. {blank}
+
____
While all Methodologies or Credit Classes registered with the Regen
Registry must be open source or open access, implementations of the
Methodology or Credit Class by Monitors can be closed source. This means
that Monitors may use proprietary tools or modules to implement the
Methodology or Credit Class, as long as they can demonstrate that their
implementation accurately follows the Methodology or Credit Class and
meets all other requirements of the Regen Registry Program.

____

=== Aggregate Projects

[arabic]
. {blank}
+
____
Project Proponents may be able to create efficiencies around reporting
and verification by strategically combining a group of project areas
participating in an Aggregate Project. To that end, project areas should
be grouped so their defining characteristics are as homogeneous as
possible. Verifiers may select randomly which project areas will receive
on-site visits, or apply a risk analysis to identify project areas with
the strongest influence over an Aggregate Project’s outcomes. Verifiers

The Approved Methodology, Credit Class and Program Guide disclose
sufficient and appropriate GHG-related information to allow all intended
users to make decisions with reasonable confidence.
____
. {blank}

____
Regen Registry is built to provide public access to all key pertinent
information related to GHG estimations such as project monitoring and
verification reports.
____

====  Conservativeness

[arabic, start=19]
. {blank}
+
____
The Approved Methodology shall define assumptions and specify
quantification methods and monitoring requirements to ensure that GHG

____

====  Emission Reduction & Removal Factors

[arabic, start=20]
. {blank}
+
____
When estimating GHG emission reductions or removals, methodologies shall
specify GHG emissions or removal factors that are:

. {blank}
+
____
The Monitor shall follow the guidelines in the Approved Methodology and
establish quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures to
manage data and information, including the assessment of uncertainty in
the Baseline and ongoing monitoring.
____

=== Additionality

____
The concept of additionality is often raised as a vital consideration
for quantifying project-based GHG reductions. Additionality is a
criteria that requires GHG reductions to only be recognized for project
activities that would not have “happened anyway.”

While there is general agreement that additionality is important, its
meaning and application remain difficult to define, frequently framed
with imprecise language, and in many cases subject to
interpretation.footnote:[https://ghginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AdditionalityPaper_Part-1ver3FINAL.pdf[[.underline]#https://ghginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AdditionalityPaper_Part-1ver3FINAL.pdf#]]

Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, a multi-stakeholder partnership of
businesses, NGOs, governments, and academics convened by the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World
Resources Institute (WRI), does not require demonstration of
additionality, but instead recommends incorporating it as an implicit
part of the procedures used to estimate baseline
emissionsfootnote:[https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg_project_accounting.pdf[[.underline]#https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg_project_accounting.pdf#]].
Depending on the methodology, as appropriate for each context, this may
be either a performance-based approach or a project-based approach,
using either a static or a dynamic baseline, and takes into account
different considerations and barriers to adoption.
____

[arabic, start=3]
. {blank}
+
____
Each Credit Class shall stipulate the relevant additionality
requirements to that credit.
____

=== Leakage

____
Leakage is an increase in GHG emissions or decrease in sequestration
outside the project boundaries that occurs because of the project’s
actions.
____

[arabic, start=4]
. {blank}
+
____
Each Credit Class shall define the appropriate procedures to address
leakage.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Over time, if certain land management activities have consistently been
found to create substantial leakage across multiple projects, Regen
Registry may remove those activities from the approved list of
practices.
____

=== Permanence 

____
In GHG accounting, permanence refers to the risk that a carbon reservoir
may be subject to gradual long-term or sudden disruptive release that
will reverse the benefit that occurred as a result of project
implementation. GHG emissions reductions from terrestrial sources and
sinks may not be permanent if a project has exposure to risk factors,
such as intentional or unintentional events that result in emissions
into the atmosphere of sequestered CO2e for which offset credits were
issued. Terrestrial projects have the potential for GHG removals to be
reversed upon exposure to risk factors, including both unintentional
reversals (e.g. fire, flood, and insect infestation) and intentional
reversals (e.g., landowners choosing to discontinue land management
and/or participate in an activity that reverses the
sequestration).footnote:[https://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/american-carbon-registry-standard-3/acr-standard-v6-0-may-2019-public-comment-version.pdf[[.underline]#https://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/american-carbon-registry-standard-3/acr-standard-v6-0-may-2019-public-comment-version.pdf#]]

Land use-based and forestry projects may require the Project Proponent
to register covenants on their land and/or restrict land use for the
duration of the Permanence Period as defined in the Credit Class. This
approach is not financially viable for most Project Proponents as the
covenant often results in a reduction in the market value of the land
that is greater than the potential additional revenues from credit
sales. Further, there is no length of time, short of perpetual, that is
equated with the assurance of permanence, nor is there a sound
scientific basis or accepted international standard around any number of
years that equates to an emission reduction/removal being permanent.
____

[arabic, start=6]
. {blank}
+
____
Regen Registry requires that Permanence Periods are specified in each
Credit Class. The Project Proponent has the following requirements as it
relates to permanence assurances:
____

* {blank}
+
____
Allocate the additional amount specified in each Credit Class of each
credit issuance (in addition to the Buffer Pool) to a dedicated
Permanence Reversal Buffer; and
____
* {blank}
+
____
Register as necessary, under the requirements of the particular Credit
Class, appropriate covenant(s) on the land from the Project Registration
until the end of the permanence period specified in the Credit Class.
See Section 7.1.2 for requirements surrounding restrictive covenants
running with the land to meet permanence requirements.
____

____
The Project Proponent states their choice in the Project Plan.
____

[arabic]
. {blank}
+

permanence assurance for the renewed project.
____
. {blank}
+
____
If the Project Proponent chooses the Permanence Reversal Buffer, at the
end of the permanence period , the Project Proponent will conduct a
permanence monitoring and verification round in order to verify carbon
retention. See Permanence Reversal Buffer section for more details.
____
. {blank}
+
____
Each Credit Class can create alternative permanence requirements as
appropriate.
____

=== Buffer Pools

____
Carbon sequestration projects have the potential for GHG removals to be
reversed unintentionally or overestimated. The Buffer Pool serves as a
tool to mitigate the general and project-specific risk factors,
including the overall uncertainty risk in GHG estimations (on top of the
portion accounted for already by the Approved Methodology). Buffer pool
contributions shall be decided at the Credit Class level, and designed
and implemented by Credit Class Adms. While Buffer Pools are primarily
used in GHG emission reduction and removal projects, they can be applied
to any type of ecological crediting program.
____

==== Types of Buffer Pools 

____
Credit Class Buffer Pools are those which aggregate risk across all
projects registered under a given Credit Class, meaning that all

=== Avoiding Double Counting 

____
Double counting refers to situations where a single GHG emission
reduction or removal is used more than once to demonstrate achievement
of mitigation targets and/or pledges typically made by
corporations/entities and countries. Double counting can occur either as
double issuance, double sale, or double claiming.

Double claiming is of concern in international carbon trading and in
determining Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris
Agreementfootnote:[https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement[[.underline]#https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement#]],
when an emission reduction is counted once by the country of origin when
reporting its emissions inventory, and again by the receiving country
(or other entity) when justifying emissions above its pledged climate
effort. In the absence of rules, a country of origin could reduce
emissions to meet its pledged effort and transfer those to a recipient;
the recipient could then claim those same reductions to meet its pledged
effort. In that case, only one reduction has actually occurred, but it
is being claimed twice. Analyses indicate that such double-claiming
could eliminate the entire climate benefit of all the
NDCs.footnote:[https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/double-counting-handbook.pdf[[.underline]#https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/double-counting-handbook.pdf#]]

Regen Registry has program rules and operational processes to mitigate
these double counting risks. To avoid double claiming, all credits will
be tracked on Regen Ledger, a custom-built ecological ledger leveraging
blockchain technology (specifically the Cosmos
SDKfootnote:[https://cosmos.network/[[.underline]#https://cosmos.network/#]]),
which provides public immutable records for transactions. The data on
Regen Ledger is available for external scrutiny and validation and
provides a digital audit trail for transactions, at any given point in
time. Examples include who was issued credits and their location, who
currently owns credits, when each credit was retired, and who claimed
the GHG benefit and their location.

When any country or state approves the trading of carbon credits (along
with the carbon claims associated with them), Regen Registry will adhere
to guidelines as established by the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change
(UNFCCC)footnote:[https://unfccc.int/[[.underline]#https://unfccc.int/#]]
and Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
(CORSIA)footnote:[https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx[[.underline]#https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx#]]

per the requirements stipulated in the Credit Class.

Regen Registry seeks a balance between adequate assurances, the
overhead, and costs associated with verification. Therefore, each Credit
Class can stipulate the requirements that are best suited to the
ecosystem, best management practice and/or locale(s) to which it
pertains.

adhere to all the requirements in the Program Guide, and respective
Credit Class and Methodology. To avoid double issuance of GHG credits
(whether removals or emission reduction) see also the requirements in
the ‘Avoiding double counting’ section.

== References

The Program Guide is based on the foundation laid by the reference
standards and documentation below. These assisted RND to articulate our
own requirements and specifications for the MRV requirements, especially
as it relates to GHG guidelines that apply to AFOLU project-based
credits.

In particular the Program Guide has been informed by these
organizations:

* American Carbon
Registryfootnote:[https://americancarbonregistry.org/[[.underline]#https://americancarbonregistry.org/#]]
* The Australian Government’s Emission Reduction
Fundfootnote:[http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/ERF/[[.underline]#http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/ERF/#]]
